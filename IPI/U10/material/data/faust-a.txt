61: Part I: Dedication
62: 
63: Again you show yourselves, you wavering Forms,
64: Revealed, as you once were, to clouded vision.
65: Shall I attempt to hold you fast once more?
66: Heart’s willing still to suffer that illusion?
67: You crowd so near! Well then, you shall endure,         5
68: And rouse me, from your mist and cloud’s confusion:
69: My spirit feels so young again: it’s shaken
70: By magic breezes that your breathings waken.
71: 
72: You bring with you the sight of joyful days,
73: And many a loved shade rises to the eye:               10
74: And like some other half-forgotten phrase,
75: First Love returns, and Friendship too is nigh:
76: Pain is renewed, and sorrow: all the ways,
77: Life wanders in its labyrinthine flight,
78: Naming the good, those that Fate has robbed            15
79: Of lovely hours, those slipped from me and lost.
80: 
81: They can no longer hear this latest song,
82: Spirits, to whom I gave my early singing:
83: That kindly crowd itself is now long gone,
84: Alas, it dies away, that first loud ringing!           20
85: I bring my verses to the unknown throng,
86: My heart’s made anxious even by their clapping,
87: And those besides delighted by my verse,
88: If they still live, are scattered through the Earth.
89: 
90: I feel a long and unresolved desire                    25
91: For that serene and solemn land of ghosts:
92: It quivers now, like an Aeolian lyre,
93: My stuttering verse, with its uncertain notes,
94: A shudder takes me: tear on tear, entire,
95: The firm heart feels weakened and remote:              30
96: What I possess seems far away from me,
97: And what is gone becomes reality.
98: Part I: Prelude On Stage
99: 
100: (Director, Dramatist, Comedian)
101: 
102: Director
103: 
104: You two, who’ve often stood by me,
105: In times of need, when trouble’s breaking,
106: Say what success our undertaking                  35
107: Will meet with, then, in Germany?
108: I’d rather like the crowd to enjoy it,
109: Since they live and let live, truly.
110: The stage is set, the boards complete,
111: And they await our festivity.                     40
112: They’re seated already, eyebrows raised,
113: Calmly hoping they’ll be amazed.
114: I know how to make the people happy:
115: But I’ve never been so embarrassed: not
116: That they’ve been used to the best, you see,      45
117: Yet they’ve all read such a dreadful lot.
118: How can we make it all seem fresh and new,
119: Weighty, but entertaining too?
120: I’d love to see a joyful crowd, that’s certain,
121: When the waves drive them to our place,           50
122: And with tremendous and repeated surging,
123: Squeeze them through the narrow gate of grace:
124: In the light of day they’re there already,
125: Pushing, till they’ve reached the window,
126: As if they’re at the baker’s, starving, nearly    55
127: Breaking their necks: just for a ticket. Oh!
128: Only poets can work this miracle on men
129: So various: the day is yours, my friend!
130: Dramatist
131: 
132: O, don’t speak to me of that varied crew,
133: The sight of whom makes inspiration fade.         60
134: Veil, from me, the surging multitude,
135: Whose whirling will drives us everyway.
136: No, some heavenly silence lead me to,
137: Where for the poet alone pure joy’s at play:
138: Where Love and Friendship too grace our hearts,   65
139: Created and inspired by heavenly arts.
140: 
141: Ah! What springs here from our deepest being,
142: What the shy trembling lips in speaking meant,
143: Now falling awry, and now perhaps succeeding,
144: Is swallowed in the fierce Moment’s violence.     70
145: Often, when the first years are done, unseeing,
146: It appears at last, complete, in deepest sense.
147: What dazzles is a Momentary act:
148: What’s true is left for posterity, intact.
149: 
150: Comedian
151: 
152: Don’t speak about posterity to me!                75
153: If I went on about posterity,
154: Where would you get your worldly fun?
155: Folk want it, and they’ll still have some.
156: The presence of a fine young man
157: Is nice, I think, for everyone.                   80
158: Who, comfortably, shares his wit,
159: And to their moods takes no exception:
160: He’ll make himself a greater hit,
161: And win a more secure reception.
162: Be brave, and show them what you’ve got,          85
163: Have Fantasy with all her chorus, yes,
164: Mind, Reason, Passion, Tears, the lot,
165: But don’t you leave out Foolishness.
166: Director
167: 
168: Make sure, above all, plenty’s happening there!
169: They come to look, and then they want to stare.         90
170: Spin endlessly before their faces,
171: So the people gape amazed,
172: You’ve won them by your many paces,
173: You’ll be the man most praised.
174: The mass are only moved by things en masse,             95
175: Each one, himself, will choose the bit he needs:
176: Who brings a lot, brings something that will pass:
177: And everyone goes home contentedly.
178: You’ll give a piece, why then give it them in pieces!
179: With such a stew you’re destined for success.           100
180: Easy to serve, it’s as easy to invent.
181: What use to bring them your complete intent?
182: The Public will soon pick at what you’ve dressed.
183: 
184: Dramatist
185: 
186: You don’t see how badly such work will do!
187: How little it suits the genuine creator!                105
188: Already, I see, it’s a principle with you.
189: The finest master is a sloppy worker.
190: 
191: Director
192: 
193: Such a reproach leaves me unmoved:
194: The man who seeks to be approved,
195: Must stick to the best tools for it,                    110
196: Think, soft wood’s the best to split,
197: And have a look for whom you write!
198: See, this is one that boredom drives,
199: Another’s from some overloaded table,
200: Or, worst of all, he’s one arrives,                     115
201: Like most, fresh from the daily paper.
202: They rush here mindlessly, as to a Masque,
203: And curiosity inspires their hurry:
204: The ladies bring themselves, and in their best,
205: Come and play their parts and ask no fee.        120
206: What dream of yours is this, exalted verse?
207: Doesn’t a full house make you happy?
208: Have a good look at your patrons first!
209: One half are coarse, the rest are chilly.
210: After the show he hopes for card-play:           125
211: He hopes for a wild night, and a woman’s kiss.
212: Why then do so many poor fools plague,
213: The sweet Muse, for such a goal as this?
214: I tell you, just give them more and more,
215: So you’ll never stray far from the mark,         130
216: Just seek to confuse them, in the dark:
217: To keep them happy, that’s hard - for sure.
218: And now what’s wrong? Delight or Pain?
219: Dramatist
220: 
221: Go, look for another scribbler by night!
222: Shall the poet throw away the highest right,         135
223: The right of humanity, that Nature gave,
224: Carelessly, so that you might gain!
225: How will he move all hearts again?
226: How will each element be his slave?
227: Is that harmony nothing, from his breast unfurled,   140
228: That draws back into his own heart, the world?
229: When Nature winds the lengthened filaments,
230: Indifferently, on her eternal spindle,
231: When all the tuneless mass of elements,
232: In their sullen discord, jar and jangle –            145
233: Who parts the ever-flowing ranks of creation,
234: Stirs them, so rhythmic measure is assured?
235: Who calls the One to general ordination,
236: Where it may ring in marvellous accord?
237: Who lets the storm wind rage with passion,           150
238: The sunset glow the senses move?
239: Who scatters every lovely springtime blossom
240: Beneath the footsteps of the one we love?
241: Who weaves the slight green wreath of leaves,
242: To honour work well done in every art?               155
243: What makes Olympus sure, joins deities?
244: The power of Man, revealed by the bard.
245: Comedian
246: 
247: So use it then, all this fine energy,
248: And drive along the work of poetry,
249: To show how we are driven in Love’s play.          160
250: By chance we meet, we feel, we stay,
251: And bit by bit we’re tightly bound:
252: Happiness grows, and then it’s fenced around:
253: We’re all inflamed then comes the sorrowing:
254: Before you know it, there’s a novel brewing!       165
255: Why don’t we give such a piece!
256: Grasp the life of man complete!
257: Everyone lives, though it’s seldom confessed,
258: And wherever you grasp, there’s interest.
259: In varied pictures there’s little light,           170
260: A lot of error, and a gleam of right,
261: So the best of drinks is brewed,
262: So the world’s cheered and renewed.
263: Then see the flower of lovely youth collect,
264: To hear your words, and view the offering,         175
265: And every tender nature will extract
266: A melancholy food from what you bring,
267: They’ll gain now this and that from your art,
268: So each sees what is present in their heart.
269: They’re readily moved to weeping or to laughter,   180
270: They’ll admire your verve, and enjoy the show:
271: What’s finished you can never alter after:
272: Minds still in growth will be grateful, though.
273: Dramatist
274: 
275: So give me back that time again,
276: When I was still ‘becoming’,                 185
277: When words gushed like a fountain
278: In new, and endless flowing,
279: Then for me mists veiled the world,
280: In every bud the wonder glowed,
281: A thousand flowers I unfurled,               190
282: That every valley, richly, showed.
283: I had nothing, yet enough:
284: Joy in illusion, thirst for truth.
285: Give every passion, free to move,
286: The deepest bliss, filled with pain,         195
287: The force of hate, the power of love,
288: Oh, give me back my youth again!
289: 
290: Comedian
291: 
292: Youth is what you need, dear friend,
293: When enemies jostle you, of course,
294: And girls, filled with desire, bend          200
295: Their arms around your neck, with force,
296: When the swift-run race’s garland
297: Beckons from the hard-won goal,
298: When from the swirling dance, a man
299: Drinks until the night is old.               205
300: But to play that well-known lyre
301: With courage and with grace,
302: Moved by self-imposed desire,
303: At a sweet wandering pace,
304: That is your function, Age,                  210
305: And our respect won’t lessen.
306: Age doesn’t make us childish, as they say,
307: It finds that we’re still children.
308: 
309: Director
310: 
311: That’s enough words for the moment,
312: Now let me see some action!                 215
313: While you’re handing out the compliments,
314: You should also make things happen.
315: Why talk so much of inspiration?
316: Delay won’t make it flow, you see.
317: Since Poetry gave the gift of creation,     220
318: Take your orders then from Poetry.
319: You know what’s wanted here,
320: We need strong ale to appear:
321: So brew me a barrel right away!
322: Tomorrow won’t do what’s undone today,      225
323: We shouldn’t waste a minute, so
324: Decide what’s possible, and just
325: Grasp it firmly like a hoe,
326: Make sure that you let nothing go,
327: And work it about, because you must.        230
328: On the German stage, you see,
329: Everyone tries out what he can:
330: Don’t fail to show me, I’m your man,
331: Your trap-doors, and your scenery.
332: Use heavenly lights, the big and small,     235
333: Squander stars in any number,
334: Rocky cliffs, and fire, and water,
335: Birds and creatures, use them all.
336: So in our narrow playhouse waken
337: The whole wide circle of creation,          240
338: And stride, deliberately, as well,
339: From Heaven, through the world, to Hell.
340: Part I: Prologue In Heaven
341: 
342: (God, the Heavenly Hosts, and then Mephistopheles.)
343: 
344: (The Three Archangels step forward.)
345: 
346: Raphael
347: 
348: The Sun sings out, in ancient mode,
349: His note among his brother-spheres,
350: And ends his pre-determined road,                     245
351: With peals of thunder for our ears.
352: The sight of him gives Angels power,
353: Though none can understand the way:
354: The inconceivable work is ours,
355: As bright as on the primal day.                       250
356: 
357: 
358: Gabriel
359: 
360: And swift, and swift, beyond conceiving,
361: The splendour of the Earth turns round,
362: A Paradisial light is interleaving,
363: With night’s awesome profound.
364: The ocean breaks with shining foam,                   255
365: Against the rocky cliffs deep base,
366: And rock and ocean whirl and go,
367: In the spheres’ swift eternal race.
368: 
369: Michael
370: 
371: And storms are roaring in their race
372: From sea to land, and land to sea,                    260
373: Their raging forms a fierce embrace,
374: All round, of deepest energy.
375: The lightning’s devastations blaze
376: Along the thunder-crashes’ way:
377: Yet, Lord, your messengers, shall praise              265
378: The gentle passage of your day.
379: All Three
380: 
381: The sight of it gives Angels power
382: Though none can understand the way,
383: And all your noble work is ours,
384: As bright as on the primal day.                         270
385: 
386: Mephistopheles
387: 
388: Since, O Lord, you near me once again,
389: To ask how all below is doing now,
390: And usually receive me without pain,
391: You see me too among the vile crowd.
392: Forgive me: I can’t speak in noble style,               275
393: And since I’m still reviled by this whole crew,
394: My pathos would be sure to make you smile,
395: If you had not renounced all laughter too.
396: You’ll get no word of suns and worlds from me.
397: How men torment themselves is all I see.                280
398: The little god of Earth sticks to the same old way,
399: And is as strange as on that very first day.
400: He might appreciate life a little more: he might,
401: If you hadn’t lent him a gleam of Heavenly light:
402: He calls it Reason, but only uses it                    285
403: To be more a beast than any beast as yet.
404: He seems to me, saving Your Grace,
405: Like a long-legged grasshopper: through space
406: He’s always flying: he flies and then he springs,
407: And in the grass the same old song he sings.            290
408: If he’d just lie there in the grass it wouldn’t hurt!
409: But he buries his nose in every piece of dirt.
410: 
411: God
412: 
413: Have you nothing else to name?
414: Do you always come here to complain?
415: Does nothing ever go right on the Earth?                295
416: Mephistopheles
417: 
418: No, Lord! I find, as always, it couldn’t be worse.
419: I’m so involved with Man’s wretched ways,
420: I’ve even stopped plaguing them, myself, these days.
421: 
422: God
423: 
424: Do you know, Faust?
425: 
426: Mephistopheles
427: 
428:                           The Doctor?
429: 
430: God
431:                                         My servant, first!
432: 
433: Mephistopheles
434: 
435: In truth! He serves you in a peculiar manner.                300
436: There’s no earthly food or drink at that fool’s dinner.
437: He drives his spirit outwards, far,
438: Half-conscious of its maddened dart:
439: From Heaven demands the brightest star,
440: And from the Earth, Joy’s highest art,                       305
441: And all the near and all the far,
442: Fails to release his throbbing heart.
443: 
444: God
445: 
446: Though he’s still confused at how to serve me,
447: I’ll soon lead him to a clearer dawning,
448: In the green sapling, can’t the gardener see                 310
449: The flowers and fruit the coming years will bring.
450: Mephistopheles
451: 
452: What do you wager? I might win him yet!
453: If you give me your permission first,
454: I’ll lead him gently on the road I set.
455: 
456: God
457: 
458: As long as he’s alive on Earth,                315
459: So long as that I won’t forbid it,
460: For while man strives he errs.
461: 
462: Mephistopheles
463: 
464: My thanks: I’ve never willingly seen fit
465: To spend my time amongst the dead,
466: I much prefer fresh cheeks instead.            320
467: To corpses, I close up my house:
468: Or it’s too like a cat with a mouse.
469: 
470: God
471: 
472: Well and good, you’ve said what’s needed!
473: Divert this spirit from his source,
474: You know how to trap him, lead him,
475: On your downward course,                       325
476: And when you must, then stand, amazed:
477: A good man, in his darkest yearning,
478: Is still aware of virtue’s ways.
479: 
480: Mephistopheles
481: 
482: That’s fine! There’s hardly any waiting.       330
483: My wager’s more than safe I’m thinking.
484: When I achieve my goal, in winning,
485: You’ll let me triumph with a swelling heart.
486: He’ll eat the dust, and with an art,
487: Like the snake my mother, known for sinning.   335
488: God
489: 
490: You can appear freely too:
491: Those like you I’ve never hated.
492: Of all the spirits who deny, it’s you,
493: The jester, who’s most lightly weighted.
494: Man’s energies all too soon seek the level,              340
495: He quickly desires unbroken slumber,
496: So I gave him you to join the number,
497: To move, and work, and play the devil.
498: But you the genuine sons of light,
499: Enjoy the living beauty bright!                          345
500: Becoming, that works and lives forever,
501: Embrace you in love’s limits dear,
502: And all that may as Appearance waver,
503: Fix firmly with everlasting Idea!
504: 
505: (Heaven closes, and the Archangels separate.)
506: 
507: Mephistopheles (alone)
508: 
509: I like to hear the Old Man’s words, from time to time,   350
510: And take care, when I’m with him, not to spew.
511: It’s very nice when such a great Gentleman,
512: Chats with the devil, in ways so human, too!
513: Part I Scene I: Night
514: 
515: (In a high-vaulted Gothic chamber, Faust, in a chair at his desk, restless.)
516: 
517: Ah! Now I’ve done Philosophy,
518: I’ve finished Law and Medicine,                                         355
519: And sadly even Theology:
520: Taken fierce pains, from end to end.
521: Now here I am, a fool for sure!
522: No wiser than I was before:
523: Master, Doctor’s what they call me,                                     360
524: And I’ve been ten years, already,
525: Crosswise, arcing, to and fro,
526: Leading my students by the nose,
527: And see that we can know - nothing!
528: It almost sets my heart burning.                                        365
529: I’m cleverer than all these teachers,
530: Doctors, Masters, scribes, preachers:
531: I’m not plagued by doubt or scruple,
532: Scared by neither Hell nor Devil –
533: Instead all Joy is snatched away,                                       370
534: What’s worth knowing, I can’t say,
535: I can’t say what I should teach
536: To make men better or convert each.
537: And then I’ve neither goods nor gold,
538: No worldly honour, or splendour hold:                                   375
539: Not even a dog would play this part!
540: So I’ve given myself to Magic art,
541: To see if, through Spirit powers and lips,
542: I might have all secrets at my fingertips.
543: And no longer, with rancid sweat, so,                                   380
544: Still have to speak what I cannot know:
545: That I may understand whatever
546: Binds the world’s innermost core together,
547: See all its workings, and its seeds,
548: Deal no more in words’ empty reeds.                                     385
549: O, may you look, full moon that shines,
550: On my pain for this last time:
551: So many midnights from my desk,
552: I have seen you, keeping watch:
553: When over my books and paper,                    390
554: Saddest friend, you appear!
555: Ah! If on the mountain height
556: I might stand in your sweet light,
557: Float with spirits in mountain caves,
558: Swim the meadows in twilight’ waves,             395
559: Free from the smoke of knowledge too,
560: Bathe in your health-giving dew!
561: Alas! In this prison must I stick?
562: This hollow darkened hole of brick,
563: Where even the lovely heavenly light             400
564: Shines through stained glass, dull not bright.
565: Hemmed in, by heaps of books,
566: Piled to the highest vault, and higher,
567: Worm eaten, decked with dust,
568: Surrounded by smoke-blackened paper,             405
569: Glass vials, boxes round me, hurled,
570: Stuffed with Instruments thrown together,
571: Packed with ancestral lumber –
572: This is my world! And what a world!
573: And need you ask why my heart                    410
574: Makes such tremors in my breast?
575: Why all my life-energies are
576: Choked by some unknown distress?
577: Smoke and mildew hem me in,
578: Instead of living Nature, then,                  415
579: Where God once created Men,
580: Bones of creatures, and dead limbs!
581: Fly! Upwards! Into Space, flung wide!
582: Isn’t this book, with secrets crammed,
583: From Nostradamus’ very hand,                     420
584: Enough to be my guide?
585: When I know the starry road,
586: And Nature, you instruct me,
587: My soul’s power, you shall flow,
588: As spirits can with spirits be.                  425
589: Useless, this dusty pondering here
590: To read the sacred characters:
591: Soar round me, Spirits, and be near:
592: If you hear me, then answer!
593: (He opens the Book, and sees the Symbol of the Macrocosm)
594: 
595: Ah! In a moment, what bliss flows                                   430
596: Through my senses from this Sign!
597: I feel life’s youthful, holy joy: it glows,
598: Fresh in every nerve and vein of mine.
599: This symbol now that calms my inward raging,
600: Perhaps a god deigned to write,                                     435
601: Filling my poor heart with delight,
602: And with its mysterious urging
603: Revealing, round me, Nature’s might?
604: Am I a god? All seems so clear to me!
605: It seems the deepest works of Nature                                440
606: Lie open to my soul, with purest feature.
607: Now I understand what wise men see:
608: “The world of spirits is not closed:
609: Your senses are: your heart is dead!
610: Rise, unwearied, disciple: bathe instead                            445
611: Your earthly breast in the morning’s glow!”
612: 
613: (He gazes at the Symbol.)
614: 
615: How each to the Whole its selfhood gives,
616: One in another works and lives!
617: How Heavenly forces fall and rise,
618: Golden vessels pass each other by!                                  450
619: Blessings from their wings disperse:
620: They penetrate from Heaven to Earth,
621: Sounding a harmony through the Universe!
622: Such a picture! Ah, alas! Merely a picture!
623: How then can I grasp you endless Nature?                            455
624: Where are your breasts that pour out Life entire,
625: To which the Earth and Heavens cling so,
626: Where withered hearts would drink? You flow
627: You nourish, yet I languish so, in vain desire.
628: 
629: (He strikes the book indignantly, and catches sight of the Symbol
630: of the Earth-Spirit.)
631: How differently it works on me, this Sign!                           460
632: You, the Spirit of Earth, are nearer:
633: Already, I feel my power is greater,
634: Already, I glow, as with fresh wine.
635: I feel the courage to engage the world,
636: Into the pain and joy of Earth be hurled,                            465
637: And though the storm wind is unfurled,
638: Fearless, in the shipwreck’s teeth, be whirled.
639: There’s cloud above me –
640: The Moon hides its light –
641: The lamp flickers!
642: Now it dies! Crimson rays dart                                       470
643: Round my head – Horror
644: Flickers from the vault above,
645: And grips me tight!
646: I feel you float around me,                                          475
647: Spirit, I summon to appear, speak to me!
648: Ah! What tears now at the core of me!
649: All my senses reeling
650: With fresh feeling!
651: I feel you draw my whole heart towards you!                          480
652: You must! You must! Though my Life’s lost, too!
653: 
654: (He grips the book and speaks the mysterious name of the Spirit. A crimson
655: flame flashes, the Spirit appears in the flame.)
656: 
657: Spirit
658: 
659: Who calls me?
660: 
661: Faust (Looking away)
662: 
663:                          Terrible to gaze at!
664: 
665: Spirit
666: 
667: Mightily you have drawn me to you,
668: Long, from my sphere, snatched your food,
669: And now –
670: Faust
671: 
672:                    Ah! Endure you, I cannot!                485
673: 
674: Spirit
675: 
676: You beg me to show myself, you implore,
677: You wish to hear my voice, and see my face:
678: The mighty prayer of your soul weighs
679: With me, I am here! – What wretched terror
680: Grips you, the Superhuman! Where is your soul’s calling?    490
681: Where is the heart that made a world inside, enthralling:
682: Carried it, nourished it, swollen with joy, so tremulous,
683: That you too might be a Spirit, one of us?
684: Where are you, Faust, whose ringing voice
685: Drew towards me with all your force?                        495
686: Are you he, who, breathing my breath,
687: Trembles in all your life’s depths,
688: A fearful, writhing worm?
689: 
690: Faust
691: 
692: Shall I fear you: you form of fire?
693: I am, I am Faust: I am your peer!                           500
694: 
695: Spirit
696: 
697: In Life’s wave, in action’s storm,
698: I float, up and down,
699: I blow, to and fro!
700: Birth and the tomb,
701: An eternal flow,                                            505
702: A woven changing,
703: A glow of Being.
704: Over Time’s quivering loom intent,
705: Working the Godhead’s living garment.
706: 
707: Faust
708: 
709: You who wander the world, on every hand,                    510
710: Active Spirit, how close to you I feel!
711: 
712: Spirit
713: 
714: You’re like the Spirit that you understand
715: Not me!
716: 
717: (It vanishes.)
718: 
719: Faust (Overwhelmed)
720: 
721: Not you?
722: Who then?                                                           515
723: I, the image of the Godhead!
724: Not even like you?
725: 
726: (A knock.)
727: 
728: Oh, fate! I know that sound – it’s my attendant –
729: My greatest fortune’s ruined!
730: In all the fullness of my doing,                                    520
731: He must intrude, that arid pedant!
732: 
733: (Wagner enters, in gown and nightcap, lamp in hand. Faust turns to him
734: impatiently.)
735: 
736: Wagner
737: 
738: Forgive me! But I heard you declaim:
739: Reading, I’m sure, from some Greek tragedy?
740: To profit from that art is my aim,
741: Nowadays it goes down splendidly.                                   525
742: I’ve often heard it claimed, you see
743: A priest could learn from the Old Comedy.
744: 
745: Faust
746: 
747: Yes, when the priest’s a comedian already:
748: Which might well seem to be the case.
749: Wagner
750: 
751: Ah! When a man’s so penned in his study,          530
752: And scarcely sees the world on holidays,
753: And barely through the glass, and far off then,
754: How can he lead men, through persuading them?
755: 
756: Faust
757: 
758: You can’t, if you can’t feel it, if it never
759: Rises from the soul, and sways                    535
760: The heart of every single hearer,
761: With deepest power, in simple ways.
762: You’ll sit forever, gluing things together,
763: Cooking up a stew from other’s scraps,
764: Blowing on a miserable fire,                      540
765: Made from your heap of dying ash.
766: Let apes and children praise your art,
767: If their admiration’s to your taste,
768: But you’ll never speak from heart to heart,
769: Unless it rises up from your heart’s space.       545
770: Wagner
771: 
772: Still, lecturing brings orators success:
773: I feel that I am far behind the rest.
774: 
775: Faust
776: 
777: Seek to profit honestly!
778: Don’t be an empty tinkling fool!
779: Understanding, and true clarity,              550
780: Express themselves without art’s rule!
781: And if you mean what you say,
782: Why hunt for words, anyway?
783: Yes, your speech, that glitters so,
784: Where you gather scraps for Man,              555
785: Is dead as the mist-filled winds that blow
786: Through the dried-up leaves of autumn!
787: 
788: Wagner
789: 
790: Oh, God! Art is long
791: And life is short.
792: Often the studies that I’m working on         560
793: Make me anxious, in my head and heart.
794: How hard it is to command the means
795: By which a man attains the very source!
796: Before a man has travelled half his course,
797: The wretched devil has to die it seems.       565
798: 
799: Faust
800: 
801: Parchment then, is that your holy well,
802: From which drink always slakes your thirst?
803: You’ll never truly be refreshed until
804: It pours itself from your own soul, first.
805: Wagner
806: 
807: Pardon me, but it’s a great delight                    570
808: When, moved by the spirit of the ages, we have sight
809: Of how a wiser man has thought, and how
810: Widely at last we’ve spread his word about.
811: 
812: Faust
813: 
814: Oh yes, as widely as the constellations!
815: My friend, all of the ages that are gone               575
816: Now make up a book with seven seals.
817: The spirit of the ages, that you find,
818: In the end, is the spirit of Humankind:
819: A mirror where all the ages are revealed.
820: And so often it’s all a mere misery                    580
821: Something we run away from at first sight.
822: A pile of sweepings, a lumber room, maybe
823: At best, a puppet show, that’s bright
824: With maxims, excellent, pragmatic,
825: Suitable when dolls’ mouths wax dramatic!              585
826: 
827: Wagner
828: 
829: But, the world! Men’s hearts and minds!
830: Something of those, at least, I’d like to know.
831: 
832: Faust
833: 
834: Yes, what men choose to understand!
835: Who dares to name the child’s real name, though?
836: The few who knew what might be learned,                590
837: Foolish enough to put their whole heart on show,
838: And reveal their feelings to the crowd below,
839: Mankind has always crucified and burned.
840: I beg you, friend, it’s now the dead of night,
841: We must break up this conversation.                    595
842: Wagner
843: 
844: I would have watched with you, if I might
845: Speak with you still, so learned in oration.
846: But tomorrow, on Easter’s first holy day,
847: I’ll ask my several questions, if I may.
848: I’ve pursued my work, zealously studying:          600
849: There’s much I know: yet I’d know everything.
850: (He leaves.)
851: 
852: Faust (Alone.)
853: 
854: That mind alone never loses hope,
855: That keeps to the shallows eternally,
856: Grabs, with eager hand, the wealth it sees,
857: And rejoices at the worms for which it gropes!     605
858: Dare such a human voice echo, too,
859: Where this depth of Spirit surrounds me?
860: Ah yet! For just this once, my thanks to you,
861: You sorriest of all earth’s progeny!
862: You’ve torn me away from that despair,             610
863: That would have soon overwhelmed my senses.
864: Ah! The apparition was so hugely there,
865: It might have truly dwarfed my defences.
866: I, image of the Godhead, already one,
867: Who thought the spirit of eternal truth so near,   615
868: Enjoying the light, both heavenly and clear,
869: Setting to one side the earthbound man:
870: I, more than Angel, a free force,
871: Ready to flow through Nature’s veins,
872: And, in creating, enjoy the life divine,           620
873: Pulsing with ideas: must atone again!
874: A word like thunder swept me away.
875: I dare not measure myself against you.
876: I possessed the power to summon you,
877: But not the power to make you stay.                625
878: In that blissful moment, then
879: I felt myself so small, so great:
880: Cruelly you hurled me back again,
881: Into Man’s uncertain state.
882: What shall I learn from? Or leave?                   630
883: Shall I obey that yearning?
884: Ah! Our actions, and not just our grief,
885: Impede us on life’s journey.
886: Some more and more alien substance presses
887: On the splendour that the Mind conceives:            635
888: And when we gain what this world possesses,
889: We say the better world’s dream deceives.
890: The splendid feelings that give us life,
891: Fade among the crowd’s earthly strife.
892: If imagination flew with courage, once,              640
893: And, full of hope, stretched out to eternity,
894: Now a little room is quite enough,
895: When joy on joy has gone, in time’s whirling sea.
896: Care has nested in the heart’s depths,
897: Restless, she rocks there, spoiling joy and rest,    645
898: There she works her secret pain,
899: And wears new masks, ever and again,
900: Appears as wife and child, fields and houses,
901: As water, fire, or knife or poison:
902: Still we tremble for what never strikes us,          650
903: And must still cry for what has not yet gone.
904: I am no god: I feel it all too deeply.
905: I am the worm that writhes in dust: see,
906: As in the dust it lives, and seeks to eat,
907: It’s crushed and buried by the passing feet.         655
908: Is this not dust, what these vaults hold,
909: These hundred shelves that cramp me:
910: This junk, and all the thousand-fold
911: Shapes, of a moth-ridden world, around me?
912: Will I find here what I’m lacking else,              660
913: Shall I read, perhaps, as a thousand books insist,
914: That Mankind everywhere torments itself,
915: So, here and there, some happy man exists?
916: What do you say to me, bare grinning skull?
917: Except that once your brain whirled like mine,       665
918: Sought the clear day, and in the twilight dull,
919: With a breath of truth, went wretchedly awry.
920: For sure, you instruments mock at me,
921: With cylinders and arms, wheels and cogs:
922: I stand at the door: and you should be the key:   670
923: You’re deftly cut, but you undo no locks.
924: Mysterious, even in broad daylight,
925: Nature won’t let her veil be raised:
926: What your spirit can’t bring to sight,
927: Won’t by screws and levers be displayed.          675
928: You, ancient tools, I’ve never used
929: You’re here because my father used you,
930: Ancient scroll, you’ve darkened too,
931: From smoking candles burned above you.
932: Better the little I had was squandered,           680
933: Than sweat here under its puny weight!
934: What from your father you’ve inherited,
935: You must earn again, to own it straight.
936: What’s never used, leaves us overburdened,
937: But we can use what the Moment may create!        685
938: Yet why does that place so draw my sight,
939: Is that flask a magnet for my gaze?
940: Why is there suddenly so sweet a light,
941: As moonlight in a midnight woodland plays?
942: I salute you, phial of rare potion,               690
943: I lift you down, with devotion!
944: In you I worship man’s art and mind,
945: Embodiment of sweet sleeping draughts:
946: Extract, with deadly power, refined,
947: Show your master all his craft!                   695
948: I see you, and my pain diminishes,
949: I grasp you, and my struggles grow less,
950: My spirit’s flood tide ebbs, more and more,
951: I seem to be where ocean waters meet,
952: A glassy flood gleams around my feet,             700
953: New day invites me to a newer shore.
954: A fiery chariot sweeps nearer
955: On light wings! I feel ready, free
956: To cut a new path through the ether
957: And reach new spheres of pure activity.           705
958: This greater life, this godlike bliss!
959: You, but a worm, have you earned this?
960: Choosing to turn your back, ah yes,
961: On all Earth’s lovely Sun might promise!
962: Let me dare to throw those gates open,            710
963: That other men go creeping by!
964: Now’s the time, to prove through action
965: Man’s dignity may rise divinely high,
966: Never trembling at that void where,
967: Imagination damns itself to pain,                 715
968: Striving towards the passage there,
969: Round whose mouth all Hell’s fires flame:
970: Choose to take that step, happy to go
971: Where danger lies, where Nothingness may flow.
972: Come here to me, cup of crystal, clear!           720
973: Free of your ancient cover now appear,
974: You whom I’ve never, for many a year,
975: Considered! You shone at ancestral feasts,
976: Cheering the over-serious guests:
977: One man passing you to another here.              725
978: It was the drinker’s duty to explain in rhyme
979: The splendour of your many carved designs
980: Or drain it at a draught, and breathe, in time:
981: You remind me of those youthful nights of mine.
982: Now I will never pass you to a friend,            730
983: Or test my wits on your art again.
984: Here’s a juice will stun any man born:
985: It fills your hollow with a browner liquid.
986: I prepared it, now I choose the fluid,
987: At last I drink, and with my soul I bid           735
988: A high and festive greeting to the Dawn!
989: 
990: (He puts the cup to his mouth.)
991: 
992: (Bells chime and a choir sings.)
993: 
994: Choir of Angels
995: 
996: Christ has arisen!
997: Joy to the One, of us,
998: Who the pernicious,
999: Ancestral, insidious,                             740
1000: Fault has unwoven.
1001: Faust
1002: 
1003: What deep humming, what shining sound
1004: Strikes the glass from my hand with power?
1005: Already, do the hollow bells resound,
1006: Proclaiming Easter’s festive course? Our                     745
1007: Choirs, do you already sing the hymn of consolation,
1008: Which once rang out, in deathly night, in Angels’ oration,
1009: That certainty of a new testament’s hour?
1010: 
1011: Chorus of Women
1012: 
1013: With pure spices
1014: We embalmed him,                                             750
1015: We his faithful
1016: We entombed him:
1017: Linen and bindings,
1018: We unwound there,
1019: Ah! Now we find                                              755
1020: Christ is not here.
1021: 
1022: Choir of Angels
1023: 
1024: Christ has arisen!
1025: Blissful Beloved,
1026: Out of what grieved,
1027: Tested, and healed:                                          760
1028: His trial is won.
1029: 
1030: Faust
1031: 
1032: You heavenly sounds, powerful and mild,
1033: Why, in the dust, here, do you seek me?
1034: Ring out where tender hearts are reconciled.
1035: I hear your message, but faith fails me:                     765
1036: The marvellous is faith’s dearest child.
1037: I don’t attempt to rise to that sphere,
1038: From which the message rings:
1039: Yet I know from childhood what it sings,
1040: And I’m recalled to life once more.                          770
1041: In other times a Heavenly kiss would fall
1042: On me, in the deep Sabbath silence:
1043: The bell notes filled with presentiments,
1044: And a prayer was pleasure’s call:
1045: A sweet yearning, beyond my understanding,   775
1046: Set me wandering through woods and fields,
1047: And while a thousand tears were burning
1048: I felt a world around me come to be.
1049: Love called out the lively games of youth,
1050: The joy of spring’s idle holiday:            780
1051: Memory’s childish feelings, in truth,
1052: Hold me back from the last sombre way.
1053: O, sing on you sweet songs of Heaven!
1054: My tears flow, Earth claims me again!
1055: 
1056: Chorus of Disciples
1057: 
1058: Has the buried one                           785
1059: Already, living,
1060: Raised himself, alone,
1061: Splendidly soaring:
1062: Is he, in teeming air,
1063: Near to creative bliss:                      790
1064: Ah! In sorrow, we’re
1065: Here on Earth’s breast.
1066: Lacking Him, we
1067: Languish, and sigh.
1068: Ah! Master we                                795
1069: Cry for your joy!
1070: 
1071: Choir of Angels
1072: 
1073: Christ has arisen
1074: Out of corruption’s sea.

1076: Joyfully free!                               800
1077: Actively praising him,
1078: Lovingly claiming him,
1079: Fraternally aiding him,
1080: Prayerfully journeying,
1081: Joyfully promising,      805
1082: So is the Master near,
1083: So is he here!
1084: Part I Scene II: In Front Of The City-Gate
1085: 
1086: (Passers-by of all kinds appear.)
1087: 
1088: Several Apprentices
1089: 
1090: So, then, where are you away to?
1091: 
1092: Others
1093: 
1094: We’re away to the Hunting Lodge.
1095: 
1096: The Former
1097: 
1098: We’re off to saunter by the Mill.                810
1099: 
1100: An Apprentice
1101: 
1102: Off to the Riverside Inn, I’d guess.
1103: 
1104: A Second Apprentice
1105: 
1106: The way there’s not of the best.
1107: 
1108: The Others
1109: 
1110: What about you?
1111: 
1112: A Third
1113: 
1114:                    I’m with the others, still.
1115: 
1116: A Fourth
1117: 
1118: Come to the Castle, you’ll find there
1119: The prettiest girls, the finest beer,            815
1120: And the best place for a fight.
1121: A Fifth
1122: 
1123: You quarrelsome fool, are you looking
1124: For a third good hiding?
1125: Not for me, that place, I hate its very sight.
1126: 
1127: A Maidservant
1128: 
1129: No, No! I’m going back to town.                  820
1130: 
1131: Another
1132: 
1133: We’ll find him by those poplar trees for sure.
1134: 
1135: The First
1136: 
1137: Well that’s no joy for me, now:
1138: He’ll walk by your side, of course,
1139: He’ll dance with you on the green.
1140: Where’s the fun in that for me, then!            825
1141: 
1142: 
1143: The Other
1144: 
1145: I’m sure he’s not alone, he said
1146: He’d bring along that Curly-head.
1147: 
1148: A Student
1149: 
1150: My how they strut those bold women!
1151: Brother, come on! We’ll follow them.
1152: Fierce tobacco, strong beer,                     830
1153: And a girl in her finery, I prefer.
1154: A Citizen’s Daughter
1155: 
1156: They are handsome boys there, I see!
1157: But it’s truly a disgrace:
1158: They could have the best of company,
1159: And run after a painted face!                  835
1160: 
1161: Second Student (to the first)
1162: 
1163: Not so fast! Those two behind,
1164: They walk about so sweetly,
1165: One must be that neighbour of mine:
1166: I could fall for her completely.
1167: They pass by with demure paces,                840
1168: But in the end they’ll go with us.
1169: 
1170: The First
1171: 
1172: Brother, no! I shouldn’t bother, anyway.
1173: Quick! Before our quarry gets away.
1174: The hand that wields a broom on Saturday,
1175: Gives the best caress, on Sunday too, I say.   845
1176: 
1177: Citizen
1178: 
1179: No, the new mayor doesn’t suit me!
1180: Now he’s there he’s getting cocky.
1181: And what’s he done to help the town?
1182: Isn’t it getting worse each day?
1183: As always it’s us who must obey,               850
1184: And pay more money down.
1185: 
1186: A Beggar (sings)
1187: 
1188: Fine gentlemen, and lovely ladies,
1189: Rosy-cheeked and finely dressed,
1190: You could help me, for your aid is
1191: Needed: see, ease my distress!                 855
1192: Don’t let me throw my song away,
1193: Only he who gives is happy.
1194: A day when all men celebrate,
1195: Will be a harvest day for me!
1196: 
1197: Another Citizen
1198: 
1199: On holidays there’s nothing I like better     860
1200: Than talking about war and war’s display,
1201: When in Turkey far away,
1202: People one another batter.
1203: You sit by the window: have a glass:
1204: See the bright boats glide down the river,    865
1205: Then you walk back home and bless
1206: Its peacefulness, and peace, forever.
1207: 
1208: Third Citizen
1209: 
1210: Neighbour, yes! I like that too:
1211: Let them go and break their heads,
1212: Make the mess they often do:                  870
1213: So long as we’re safe in our beds.
1214: 
1215: An Old Woman (to the citizen’s daughter)
1216: 
1217: Ah! So pretty! Sweet young blood!
1218: Who wouldn’t gaze at you?
1219: Don’t be so proud! I’m very good!
1220: And what you want, I’ll bring you.            875
1221: 
1222: The Citizen’s Daughter
1223: 
1224: Agatha, come away! I must go carefully:
1225: No walking freely with such a witch as her:
1226: For on Saint Andrew’s Night she really
1227: Showed me who’ll be my future Lover.
1228: The Other
1229: 
1230: She showed me mine in a crystal ball,          880
1231: A soldier, with lots of other brave men:
1232: I look around: among them all,
1233: Yet I can never find him.
1234: 
1235: The Soldiers
1236: 
1237: Castles with towering
1238: Ramparts and wall,                             885
1239: Proud girls showing
1240: Disdain for us all,
1241: We want them to fall!
1242: The action is brave,
1243: And splendid the pay!                          890
1244: So let the trumpet,
1245: Do our recruiting,
1246: Calling to joy
1247: Calling to ruin.
1248: It’s a storm, blowing!                         895
1249: But it’s the life too!
1250: Girls and castles
1251: We must win you.
1252: The action is brave,
1253: Splendid the pay!                              900
1254: And the soldiers
1255: Go marching away.
1256: 
1257: (Faust and Wagner)
1258: 
1259: Faust
1260: 
1261: Rivers and streams are freed from ice
1262: By Spring’s sweet enlivening glance.
1263: Valleys, green with Hope’s happiness, dance:   905
1264: Old Winter, in his weakness, sighs,
1265: Withdrawing to the harsh mountains.
1266: From there, retreating, he sends down
1267: Impotent showers of hail that show
1268: In stripes across the quickening ground.       910
1269: But the sun allows nothing white below,
1270: Change and growth are everywhere,
1271: He enlivens all with his colours there,
1272: And lacking flowers of the fields outspread,
1273: He takes these gaudy people instead.           915
1274: Turn round, and from this mountain height,
1275: Look down, where the town’s in sight.
1276: That cavernous, dark gate,
1277: The colourful crowd penetrate,
1278: All will take the sun today,                   920
1279: The Risen Lord they’ll celebrate,
1280: And feel they are resurrected,
1281: From low houses, dully made,
1282: From work, where they’re constricted,
1283: From the roofs’ and gables’ weight,            925
1284: From the crush of narrow streets,
1285: From the churches’ solemn night
1286: They’re all brought to the light.
1287: Look now: see! The crowds, their feet
1288: Crushing the gardens and meadows,              930
1289: While on the river a cheerful fleet
1290: Of little boats, everywhere it flows.
1291: And over-laden, ready to sink,
1292: The last barge takes to the stream.
1293: From far off on the mountain’s brink,
1294: All the bright clothing gleams.
1295: I hear the noise from the village risen,
1296: Here is the people’s true Heaven,
1297: High and low shout happily:
1298: Here I am Man: here, dare to be!               940
1299: Wagner
1300: 
1301: Doctor, to take a walk with you,
1302: Is an honour and a prize:
1303: Alone I’d have no business here, true,
1304: Since everything that’s coarse I despise.
1305: Shrieking, fiddlers, skittles flying,                 945
1306: To me it’s all a hateful noise:
1307: They rush about possessed, crying,
1308: And call it singing: and call it joy.
1309: 
1310: (Farm-workers under the lime tree. Dance and Song.)
1311: 
1312: The shepherd for the dance, had on
1313: His gaudy jacket, wreath, and ribbon,                 950
1314: Making a fine show,
1315: Under the linden-tree, already,
1316: Everyone was dancing madly.
1317: Hey! Hey!
1318: Hurrah! Hurray!                                       955
1319: So goes the fiddle-bow.
1320: 
1321: In his haste, in a whirl,
1322: He stumbled against a girl,
1323: With his elbow flailing:
1324: Lively, she turned, and said:                         960
1325: Mind out, you wooden-head!
1326: Hey! Hey!
1327: Hurrah! Hurray!
1328: Just watch where you’re sailing!
1329: 
1330: Fast around the circle bright,                        965
1331: They danced to left and right,
1332: Skirts and jackets flying.
1333: They grew red: they grew warm,
1334: They rested, panting, arm on arm
1335: Hey! Hey!                                             970
1336: Hurrah! Hurray!
1337: And hip, and elbow, lying.
1338: Don’t be so familiar then!
1339: That’s how many a lying man,
1340: Cheated his wife so!                         975
1341: But he soon tempted her aside,
1342: And from the linden echoed wide:
1343: Hey! Hey!
1344: Hurrah! Hurray!
1345: So goes the fiddle-bow.                      980
1346: 
1347: An Old Farmer
1348: 
1349: Doctor, it’s good of you today
1350: Not to shun the crowd,
1351: So that among the folk, at play,
1352: The learned man walks about.
1353: Then have some from the finest jug           985
1354: That we’ve filled with fresh ale first,
1355: I offer it now and wish it would,
1356: Not only quench your thirst:
1357: But the count of drops it holds
1358: May it exceed your hours, all told.          990
1359: 
1360: Faust
1361: 
1362: I’ll take some of your foaming drink,
1363: And offer you all, health and thanks.
1364: 
1365: (The people gather round him in a circle.)
1366: 
1367: The Old Farmer
1368: 
1369: Truly, it’s a thing well done:
1370: You’re here on our day of happiness,
1371: Since in evil times now gone,
1372: You’ve eased our distress!
1373: Many a man stands here alive,
1374: Whom your father, at the last,
1375: Snatched from the fever’s rage,
1376: While the plague went past.                  1000
1377: And you, only a young man, went,
1378: Into every house of sickness, then,
1379: Though many a corpse was carried forth,
1380: You walked safely out again.
1381: Many a hard trial you withstood,             1005
1382: A Helper helped by the Helper above.
1383: 
1384: All
1385: 
1386: Health to the man who’s proven true,
1387: Long may he help me and you!
1388: 
1389: Faust
1390: 
1391: To Him above bow down instead,
1392: Who teaches help, and sends his aid.         1010
1393: 
1394: (He walks off, with Wagner.)
1395: 
1396: Wagner
1397: 
1398: How it must feel, O man of genius,
1399: To be respected by the crowd!
1400: O happy he whose gifts endow
1401: Him with such advantages!
1402: The father shows you to his son, now         1015
1403: Each one asks and pushes near,
1404: The fiddle halts, and the dancers there:
1405: You pass: in ranks they stop to see,
1406: And throw their caps high in the air:
1407: A little more and they’d bend the knee,      1020
1408: As if what they worshipped was holy.
1409: 
1410: Faust
1411: 
1412: Climb these few steps to that stone,
1413: Here we’ll rest from our wandering.
1414: Here I’ve sat often, thoughtful and alone,
1415: Tormenting myself with prayer and fasting.   1025
1416: Rich in hope, and firm of faith,
1417: Wringing my hands, with sighs even,
1418: Tears, to force the end of plague
1419: From the very God of Heaven.
1420: The crowd’s approval now’s like scorn.          1030
1421: O if you could read within me
1422: How little the father and the son
1423: Deserve a fraction of their glory.
1424: My father was a gloomy, honourable man,
1425: Who pondered Nature and the heavenly spheres,   1035
1426: Honestly, in his own fashion,
1427: With eccentric studies it appears:
1428: He, in his adepts’ company,
1429: Locked in his dark workshop, forever
1430: Tried with endless recipes,                     1040
1431: To make things opposite flow together.
1432: The fiery Lion, a daring suitor,
1433: Wed the Lily, in a lukewarm bath, there
1434: In a fiery flame, both of them were
1435: Strained from one bride-bed into another,       1045
1436: Until the young Queen was descried,
1437: In a mix of colours, in the glass:
1438: There was the medicine: the patient died.
1439: And who recovered? No one asked.
1440: So we roamed, with our hellish pills,           1050
1441: Among the valleys and the hills,
1442: Worse than the pestilence itself we were.
1443: I’ve poisoned a thousand: that’s quite clear:
1444: And now from the withered old must hear
1445: How men praise a shameless murderer.            1055
1446: 
1447: Wagner
1448: 
1449: How can you grieve at that!
1450: Isn’t it enough for an honest man
1451: To exercise the skill he has,
1452: Carefully, precisely, as given?
1453: Honour your father as a youth,                  1060
1454: And receive his teaching in your soul,
1455: As a man, then, add to scientific truth,
1456: So your son can achieve a higher goal.
1457: Faust
1458: 
1459: O happy the man who still can hope
1460: Though drowned in a sea of error!              1065
1461: Man needs the things he doesn’t know,
1462: What he knows is useless, forever.
1463: But don’t let such despondency
1464: Spoil the deep goodness of the hour!
1465: In the evening glow, we see                    1070
1466: The houses gleaming, green-embowered.
1467: Mild it retreats, the day that’s left,
1468: It slips away to claim new being.
1469: Ah, that no wing from earth can lift
1470: Me, closer and closer to it, striving!         1075
1471: I’d see, in eternal evening’s light,
1472: The silent Earth beneath my feet, forever,
1473: The heights on fire, each valley quiet
1474: While silver streams flow to a golden river.
1475: The wild peaks with their deep clefts,         1080
1476: Would cease to bar my godlike way,
1477: Already the sea with its warm depths,
1478: Opens to my astonished gaze.
1479: At last the weary god sinks down to night:
1480: But in me a newer yearning wakes,              1085
1481: I hasten on, drinking his endless light:
1482: The dark behind me: and ahead the day.
1483: Heaven above me: and the waves below,
1484: A lovely dream, although it vanishes.
1485: Ah! Wings of the mind, so weightless           1090
1486: No bodily wings could ever be so.
1487: Yet it’s natural in every spirit, too,
1488: That feeling drives us, up and on,
1489: When over us, lost in the vault of blue,
1490: The lark sings his piercing song,              1095
1491: When over the steep pine-filled peaks,
1492: The eagle widely soars,
1493: And across the plains and seas,
1494: The cranes seek their home shores.
1495: Wagner
1496: 
1497: I’ve often had strange moments, I know,            1100
1498: But I’ve never felt yearnings quite like those:
1499: The joys of woods and fields soon fade
1500: I wouldn’t ask the birds for wings: indeed,
1501: How differently the mind’s raptures lead
1502: Us on, from book to book, and page to page!        1105
1503: Then winter nights are beautiful, and sweet,
1504: A blissful warmth steals through your limbs, too
1505: When you’ve unrolled some noble text, complete,
1506: Oh, how heaven’s light descends on you!
1507: 
1508: Faust
1509: 
1510: You only feel the one yearning at best,            1110
1511: Oh, never seek to know the other!
1512: Two souls, alas, exist in my breast,
1513: One separated from another:
1514: One, with its crude love of life, just
1515: Clings to the world, tenaciously, grips tight,     1115
1516: The other soars powerfully above the dust,
1517: Into the far ancestral height.
1518: Oh, let the spirits of the air,
1519: Between the heavens and Earth, weaving,
1520: Descend through the golden atmosphere,             1120
1521: And lead me on to new and varied being!
1522: Yes, if a magic cloak were mine, that
1523: Would carry me off to foreign lands,
1524: Not for the costliest garment in my hands,
1525: For the mantle of a king, would I resign it!       1125
1526: 
1527: Wagner
1528: 
1529: Don’t call to that familiar crowd,
1530: Streaming in misty circles, spreading,
1531: Preparing a thousand dangers now,
1532: On every side, for human beings.
1533: The North winds’ sharp teeth penetrate,            1130
1534: Down here, and spit you with their fangs:
1535: Then the East’s drying winds are at the gate,
1536: To feed themselves on your lungs.
1537: If, from the South, the desert sends them,
1538: And fire on fire burns on your brow,                    1135
1539: The West brings a swarm to quench them,
1540: And you and field and meadow drown.
1541: They hear us, while they’re harming us,
1542: Hear us, while they are betraying:
1543: They make out they’re from heaven above,                1140
1544: And lisp like angels when they’re lying.
1545: Let’s go on! The world has darkened,
1546: The air is cool: the mists descend!
1547: Man values his own house at night.
1548: What is it occupies your sight?                         1145
1549: What troubles you so, in the evening?
1550: 
1551: Faust
1552: 
1553: Through corn and stubble, see that black dog running?
1554: 
1555: Wagner
1556: 
1557: I saw him long ago: he seems a wretched thing.
1558: 
1559: Faust
1560: 
1561: Look at him closely! What do you make of him?
1562: 
1563: Wagner
1564: 
1565: A dog that, in the way they do,                         1150
1566: Sniffs around to find his master.
1567: 
1568: Faust
1569: 
1570: See how he winds in wide spirals too,
1571: Round us here, yet always coming nearer?
1572: And if I’m right, I see a swirl of fire
1573: Twisting about, behind his track.                       1155
1574: Wagner
1575: 
1576: Perhaps your eyesight proves a liar,
1577: I only see a dog, that’s black.
1578: 
1579: Faust
1580: 
1581: It seems to me that with a subtle magic,
1582: He winds a fatal knot around our feet.
1583: 
1584: Wagner
1585: 
1586: I see his timid and uncertain antics,            1160
1587: It’s strangers, not his master, whom he meets.
1588: 
1589: Faust
1590: 
1591: The circle narrows: now he’s here!
1592: 
1593: Wagner
1594: 
1595: You see a dog, there’s no spectre near!
1596: He barks uncertainly, lies down and crawls,
1597: Wags his tail. Dogs’ habits, after all.          1165
1598: 
1599: Faust
1600: 
1601: Come on! Here, now! Here, to me!
1602: 
1603: Wagner
1604: 
1605: He’s a dogged hound, I agree.
1606: Stand still and he holds his ground:
1607: Talk to him, he dances round:
1608: What you’ve lost, he’ll bring to you:            1170
1609: Retrieve a stick from the water, too.
1610: 
1611: Faust
1612: You’re right: and I see nothing
1613: Like a Spirit there, it’s only training.
1614: 
1615: Wagner
1616: 
1617: A wise man finds agreeable,
1618: A dog that’s learnt its lesson well.       1175
1619: Yes, he deserves all your favour,
1620: Among the students, the true scholar!
1621: 
1622: (They enter the City gate.)
1623: Part I Scene III: The Study
1624: 
1625: (Faust enters, with the dog.)
1626: 
1627: Faust
1628: 
1629: Fields and meadows now I’ve left
1630: Clothed in deepest night,
1631: Full of presentiments, a holy dread     1180
1632: Wakes the better soul in me to light.
1633: Wild desires no longer stir
1634: At every restless act of mine:
1635: Love for Humanity is here,
1636: And here is Love Divine.                1185
1637: 
1638: Quiet, dog! Stop running to and fro!
1639: Why are you snuffling at the door?
1640: Lie down now, behind the stove,
1641: There’s my best cushion on the floor.
1642: Since you amused us running, leaping,   1190
1643: Out on the mountainside, with zest,
1644: Now I take you into my keeping,
1645: A welcome, and a silent guest.
1646: 
1647: Ah, when in our narrow room,
1648: The friendly lamp glows on the shelf,   1195
1649: Brightness burns in our inner gloom,
1650: In the Heart, that knows itself.
1651: Reason speaks with insistence,
1652: And Hope once more appears,
1653: We see the River of Existence,          1200
1654: Ah, the founts of Life, are near.
1655: Don’t growl, dog! With this holy sound
1656: Which I, with all my soul, embrace,
1657: Your bestial noise seems out of place.
1658: Men usually scorn the things, I’ve found,             1205
1659: That, by them, can’t be understood,
1660: Grumbling at beauty, and the good,
1661: That to them seems wearisome:
1662: Can’t a dog, then, snarl like them?
1663: 
1664: Oh, yet now I can feel no contentment                 1210
1665: Flow through me, despite my best intent.
1666: Why must the stream fail so quickly,
1667: And once again leave us thirsty?
1668: I’ve long experience of it, yet I think
1669: I could supply what’s missing, easily:         1215
1670: We learn to value what’s beyond the earthly,
1671: We yearn to reach revelation’s brink,
1672: That’s nowhere nobler or more excellent
1673: Than where it burns in the New Testament.
1674: I yearn to render the first version,                  1220
1675: With true feeling, once and for all,
1676: Translate the sacred original
1677: Into my beloved German.
1678: (He opens the volume, and begins.)
1679: 
1680: It’s written here: ‘In the Beginning was the Word!’
1681: Here I stick already! Who can help me? It’s absurd,   1225
1682: Impossible, for me to rate the word so highly
1683: I must try to say it differently
1684: If I’m truly inspired by the Spirit. I find
1685: I’ve written here: ‘In the Beginning was the Mind’.
1686: Let me consider that first sentence,                  1230
1687: So my pen won’t run on in advance!
1688: Is it Mind that works and creates what’s ours?
1689: It should say: ‘In the beginning was the Power!’
1690: Yet even while I write the words down,
1691: I’m warned: I’m no closer with these I’ve found.      1235
1692: The Spirit helps me! I have it now, intact.
1693: And firmly write: ‘In the Beginning was the Act!’
1694: 
1695: If I’m to share my room with you,
1696: Dog, you can stop howling too:
1697: Stop your yapping!                                    1240
1698: A fellow who’s always snapping,
1699: I can’t allow too near me.
1700: One of us you see,
1701: Must leave the other free.
1702: I’ve no more hospitality to show,                     1245
1703: The door’s open, you can go.
1704: But what’s this I see!
1705: Can this happen naturally?
1706: Is it a phantom or is it real?
1707: The dog’s growing big and tall.                       1250
1708: He rises powerfully,
1709: It’s no doglike shape I see!
1710: What a spectre I brought home!
1711: Like a hippo in the room,
1712: With fiery eyes, and fearful jaws.                    1255
1713: Oh! Now, what you are, I’m sure!
1714: The Key of Solomon is good
1715: For conjuring your half-hellish brood.
1716: Spirits (In the corridor.)
1717: 
1718: Something’s trapped inside!
1719: Don’t follow it: stay outside!          1260
1720: Like a fox in a snare
1721: An old lynx from hell trembles there.
1722: Be careful what you’re about!
1723: Float here: float there,
1724: Under and over,                         1265
1725: And he’ll work his way out.
1726: If you know how to help him,
1727: Don’t let yourself fail him!
1728: Since it’s all done for sure,
1729: Just for your pleasure.                 1270
1730: 
1731: Faust
1732: 
1733: First speak the Words of the Four
1734: To encounter the creature.
1735: Salamander, be glowing,
1736: Undine, flow near,
1737: Sylph, disappear,                       1275
1738: Gnome, be delving.
1739: 
1740: Who does not know
1741: The Elements so,
1742: Their power sees,
1743: And properties,                         1280
1744: Cannot lord it
1745: Over the Spirits.
1746: 
1747: Vanish in flame,
1748: Salamander!
1749: Rush together in foam,                  1285
1750: Undine!
1751: Shine with meteor-gleam,
1752: Sylph!
1753: Bring help to the home,
1754: Incubus! Incubus!                       1290
1755: Go before and end it thus!
1756: None of the Four
1757: Show in the creature.
1758: He lies there quietly grinning at me:
1759: I’ve not stirred him enough it seems.                                 1295
1760: But you’ll hear how
1761: I’ll press him hard now.
1762: My good fellow, are you
1763: Exiled from Hell’s crew?
1764: Witness the Symbol                                                    1300
1765: Before which they bow,
1766: The dark crowd there!
1767: Now it swells, with its bristling hair.
1768: Depraved being!
1769: Can you know what you’re seeing?                                      1305
1770: The uncreated One
1771: With name unexpressed,
1772: Poured through Heaven,
1773: Pierced without redress?
1774: 
1775: Spellbound, behind the stove,                                         1310
1776: An elephant grows.
1777: It fills the room, completely,
1778: It will vanish like mist, I can see.
1779: Don’t rise to the ceiling!
1780: Lie down at your master’s feet!                                       1315
1781: You see I don’t threaten you lightly.
1782: I’ll sting you with fire that’s holy!
1783: Don’t wait for the bright
1784: Triple glowing Light!
1785: Don’t wait for                                                        1320
1786: My highest art!
1787: 
1788: (As the mist clears, Mephistopheles steps from behind the stove, dressed as a
1789: wandering Scholar.)
1790: 
1791: Mephistopheles
1792: 
1793: Why such alarms? What command would my lord impart?
1794: Faust
1795: 
1796: This was the dog’s core!
1797: A wandering scholar? The fact makes me smile.
1798: 
1799: Mephistopheles
1800: 
1801: I bow to the learned lord!                        1325
1802: You certainly made me sweat, in style.
1803: 
1804: Faust
1805: 
1806: How are you named?
1807: 
1808: Mephistopheles
1809: 
1810:                   A slight question
1811: For one who so disdains the Word,
1812: Is so distant from appearance: one
1813: Whom only the vital depths have stirred.          1330
1814: 
1815: Faust
1816: 
1817: We usually gather from your names
1818: The nature of you gentlemen: it’s plain
1819: What you are, we all too clearly recognise
1820: One who’s called Liar, Ruin, Lord of the Flies.
1821: Well, what are you then?                          1335
1822: 
1823: Mephistopheles
1824: 
1825:                 Part of the Power that would
1826: Always wish Evil, and always works the Good.
1827: 
1828: Faust
1829: 
1830: What meaning to these riddling words applies?
1831: Mephistopheles
1832: 
1833: I am the spirit, ever, that denies!
1834: And rightly so: since everything created,
1835: In turn deserves to be annihilated:                  1340
1836: Better if nothing came to be.
1837: So all that you call Sin, you see,
1838: Destruction, in short, what you’ve meant
1839: By Evil is my true element.
1840: 
1841: Faust
1842: 
1843: You call yourself a part, yet seem complete to me?
1844: 
1845: Mephistopheles
1846: 
1847: I’m speaking the truth to you, and modestly.
1848: Even if Man’s accustomed to take
1849: His small world for the Whole, that’s his mistake:
1850: I’m part of the part, that once was - everything,
1851: Part of the darkness, from which Light, issuing,     1350
1852: Proud Light, emergent, disputed the highest place
1853: With its mother Night, the bounds of Space,
1854: And yet won nothing, however hard it tried,
1855: Still stuck to Bodily Things, and so denied.
1856: It flows from bodies, which it beautifies,           1355
1857: And bodies block its way:
1858: I hope the day’s not far away
1859: When it, along with all these bodies, dies.
1860: 
1861: Faust
1862: 
1863: Now I see the plan you follow!
1864: You can’t destroy it all, and so                     1360
1865: You’re working on a smaller scale.
1866: 
1867: Mephistopheles
1868: 
1869: And frankly it’s a sorry tale.
1870: What’s set against the Nothingness,
1871: The Something, World’s clumsiness,
1872: Despite everything I’ve tried,                 1365
1873: Won’t become a nothing: though I’d
1874: Storms, quakes, and fires on every hand,
1875: It deigned to stay as sea and land!
1876: And those Men and creatures, all the damned,
1877: It’s no use my owning any of that crew:        1370
1878: How many I’ve already done with too!
1879: Yet new fresh blood is always going round.
1880: So it goes on, men make me furious!
1881: With water, earth and air, of course,
1882: A thousand buds unfurl                         1375
1883: In wet and dry, warm and cold!
1884: And if I hadn’t kept back fire of old,
1885: I’d have nothing left at all.
1886: 
1887: Faust
1888: 
1889: So you set the Devil’s fist
1890: That vainly clenches itself,                   1380
1891: Against the eternally active,
1892: Wholesome, creative force!
1893: Strange son of Chaos, start
1894: On something else instead!
1895: 
1896: Mephistopheles
1897: 
1898: Truly I’ll think about it: more                1385
1899: Next time, on that head!
1900: Might I be allowed to go?
1901: 
1902: Faust
1903: 
1904: I see no reason for you to ask it.
1905: Since I’ve learnt to know you now,
1906: When you wish: then make a visit.              1390
1907: There’s the door, here’s the window,
1908: And, of course, there’s the chimney.
1909: Mephistopheles
1910: 
1911: I must confess, I’m prevented though
1912: By a little thing that hinders me,
1913: The Druid’s-foot on your doorsill –                         1395
1914: 
1915: Faust
1916: 
1917: The Pentagram gives you pain?
1918: Then tell me, you Son of Hell,
1919: If that’s the case, how did you gain
1920: Entry? Are spirits like you cheated?
1921: 
1922: Mephistopheles
1923: 
1924: Look carefully! It’s not completed:                         1400
1925: One angle, if you inspect it closely
1926: Has, as you see, been left a little open.
1927: 
1928: Faust
1929: 
1930: Just by chance as it happens!
1931: And left you prisoner to me?
1932: Success created by approximation!                           1405
1933: 
1934: Mephistopheles
1935: 
1936: The dog saw nothing, in his animation,
1937: Now the affair seems inside out,
1938: The Devil can’t get out of the house.
1939: 
1940: Faust
1941: 
1942: Why not try the window then?
1943: 
1944: Mephistopheles
1945: 
1946: To devils and ghosts the same laws appertain:               1410
1947: The same way they enter in, they must go out.
1948: In the first we’re free, in the second slaves to the act.
1949: Faust
1950: 
1951: So you still have laws in Hell, in fact?
1952: That’s good, since it allows a pact,
1953: And one with you gentlemen truly binds?       1415
1954: 
1955: Mephistopheles
1956: 
1957: What’s promised you’ll enjoy, and find,
1958: There’s nothing mean that we enact.
1959: But it can’t be done so fast,
1960: First we’ll have to talk it through,
1961: Yet, urgently, I beg of you                   1420
1962: Let me go my way at last.
1963: 
1964: Faust
1965: 
1966: Wait a moment now,
1967: Tell me some good news first.
1968: 
1969: Mephistopheles
1970: 
1971: I’ll soon be back, just let me go:
1972: Then you can ask me what you wish.            1425
1973: 
1974: Faust
1975: 
1976: I didn’t place you here, tonight.
1977: You trapped yourself in the lime.
1978: Who snares the devil, holds him tight!
1979: He won’t be caught like that a second time.
1980: 
1981: Mephistopheles
1982: 
1983: I’m willing, if you so wish,                  1430
1984: To stay here, in your company:
1985: So long as we pass the time, and I insist,
1986: On arts of mine, exclusively.
1987: Faust
1988: 
1989: Gladly, you’re free to present
1990: Them, as long as they’re all pleasant.   1435
1991: 
1992: Mephistopheles
1993: 
1994: My friend you’ll win more
1995: For your senses, in an hour,
1996: Than in a whole year’s monotony.
1997: What the tender spirits sing,
1998: The lovely pictures that they bring,     1440
1999: Are no empty wizardry.
2000: First your sense of smell’s invited,
2001: Then your palate is delighted,
2002: And then your touch, you see.
2003: Now, I need no preparation,              1445
2004: We’re all here, so let’s begin!
2005: 
2006: Spirits
2007: 
2008: Vanish, you shadowy
2009: Vaults above!
2010: Cheerfully show,
2011: The friendliest blue                     1450
2012: Of aether, down here.
2013: Would that shadowy
2014: Clouds had gone!
2015: Starlight sparkling
2016: Milder sun                               1455
2017: Shining clear.
2018: Heavenly children
2019: In lovely confusion,
2020: Swaying and bending,
2021: Drifting past.                           1460
2022: Affectionate yearning,
2023: Following fast:
2024: Their garments flowing
2025: With fluttering ribbons,
2026: Cover the gardens,                       1465
2027: Cover the leaves,
2028: Where with each other
2029: In deep conversation
2030: Lover meets lover.
2031: Leaves on leaves!         1470
2032: Tendrils’ elation!
2033: Grapes beneath
2034: Crushed in a stream,
2035: Pressed to extreme,
2036: Crushed to fountain,      1475
2037: Of foaming wine,
2038: Trickling, fine,
2039: Through rocks divine,
2040: Leaving the heights,
2041: Spreading beneath,        1480
2042: Broad as the seas,
2043: Valleys it fills
2044: Round the green hills.
2045: And the wings still,
2046: Blissfully drunk,         1485
2047: Fly to the sun,
2048: Fly to the brightness,
2049: Towards the islands,
2050: Out of the waves
2051: Magically raised:         1490
2052: Now we can hear
2053: The choir of joy near,
2054: Over the meadow,
2055: See how they dance now,
2056: All in the air            1495
2057: Dispersing there.
2058: Some of them climbing
2059: Over the mountains,
2060: Others are swimming
2061: Over the ocean,           1500
2062: Others take flight:
2063: All towards Life,
2064: All towards distant,
2065: Love of the stars, and
2066: Approval’s bliss.         1505
2067: Mephistopheles
2068: 
2069: He’s asleep! Enough, you delicate children of air!
2070: You’ve sung to him faithfully, I declare!
2071: I’m in your debt for all this.
2072: He’s not yet the man to hold devils fast!
2073: Spellbind him with dream-forms, cast                 1510
2074: Him deep into illusions’ sea:
2075: Now, for the magic sill I must pass,
2076: I could use rat’s teeth: no need for me
2077: To conjure up a lengthier spell,
2078: One’s rustling here that will do well.               1515
2079: 
2080: The Lord of Rats and Mice,
2081: Of Flies, Frogs, Bugs and Lice,
2082: Summons you to venture here,
2083: And gnaw the threshold where
2084: He stains it with a little oil -                     1520
2085: You’ve hopped, already, to your toil!
2086: Now set to work! The fatal point,
2087: Is at the edge, it’s on the front.
2088: One more bite, then it’s complete –
2089: Now Faust, dream deeply, till we meet.               1525
2090: 
2091: Faust (Waking.)
2092: 
2093: Am I cheated then, once again?
2094: Does the Spirit-Realm’s deep yearning fade:
2095: So a mere dream has conjured up the devil,
2096: And only a dog, it was, that ran away?
2097: Part I Scene IV: The Study
2098: 
2099: (Faust, Mephistopheles)
2100: 
2101: Faust
2102: 
2103: A knock? Enter! Who’s plaguing me again?              1530
2104: 
2105: Mephistopheles
2106: 
2107: I am
2108: 
2109: Faust
2110: 
2111:         Enter!
2112: 
2113: Mephistopheles
2114: 
2115:                  Three times you must say it, then.
2116: 
2117: Faust
2118: 
2119: So! Enter!
2120: 
2121: Mephistopheles
2122: 
2123:         Ah, now, you please me.
2124: I hope we’ll get along together:
2125: To drive away the gloomy weather,
2126: I’m dressed like young nobility,                      1535
2127: In a scarlet gold-trimmed coat,
2128: In a little silk-lined cloak,
2129: A cockerel feather in my hat,
2130: With a long, pointed sword,
2131: And I advise you, at that,                            1540
2132: To do as I do, in a word:
2133: So that, footloose, fancy free,
2134: You can experience Life, with me.
2135: Faust
2136: 
2137: This life of earth, its narrowness,
2138: Pains me, however I’m turned out,                            1545
2139: I’m too old to play about,
2140: Too young, still, to be passionless.
2141: What can the world bring me again?
2142: Abstain! You shall! You must! Abstain!
2143: That’s the eternal song                                      1550
2144: That in our ears, forever, rings
2145: The one, that, our whole life long,
2146: Every hour, hoarsely, sings.
2147: I wake in terror with the dawn,
2148: I cry, the bitterest tears, to see                           1555
2149: Day grant no wish of mine, not one
2150: As it passes by on its journey.
2151: Even presentiments of joy
2152: Ebb, in wilful depreciation:
2153: A thousand grimaces life employs                             1560
2154: To hinder me in creation.
2155: Then when night descends I must
2156: Stretch out, worried, on my bed:
2157: What comes to me is never rest,
2158: But some wild dream instead.                                 1565
2159: The God that lives inside my heart,
2160: Can rouse my innermost seeing:
2161: The one enthroned beyond my art,
2162: Can’t stir external being:
2163: And so existence is a burden: sated,                         1570
2164: Death’s desired, and Life is hated.
2165: 
2166: Mephistopheles
2167: 
2168: Yet Death’s a guest who’s visit’s never wholly celebrated.
2169: 
2170: Faust
2171: 
2172: Happy the man whom victory enhances,
2173: Whose brow the bloodstained laurel warms,
2174: Who, after the swift whirling dances,                        1575
2175: Finds himself in some girl’s arms!
2176: If only, in my joy, then, I’d sunk down
2177: Before that enrapturing Spirit power!
2178: 
2179: Mephistopheles
2180: 
2181: Yet someone, from a certain brown
2182: Liquid, drank not a drop, at midnight hour.   1580
2183: 
2184: Faust
2185: 
2186: It seems that you delight in spying.
2187: 
2188: Mephistopheles
2189: 
2190: I know a lot: and yet I’m not all-knowing.
2191: 
2192: Faust
2193: 
2194: When sweet familiar tones drew me,
2195: Away from the tormenting crowd,
2196: Then my other childhood feelings              1585
2197: Better times echoed, and allowed.
2198: So I curse whatever snares the soul,
2199: In its magical, enticing arms,
2200: Banishes it to this mournful hole,
2201: With dazzling, seductive charms!              1590
2202: Cursed be those high Opinions first,
2203: With which the mind entraps itself!
2204: Then glittering Appearance curse,
2205: In which the senses lose themselves!
2206: Curse what deceives us in our dreaming,       1595
2207: With thoughts of everlasting fame!
2208: Curse the flattery of ‘possessing’
2209: Wife and child, lands and name!
2210: Curse Mammon, when he drives us
2211: To bold acts to win our treasure:             1600
2212: Or straightens out our pillows
2213: For us to idle at our leisure!
2214: Curse the sweet juice of the grape!
2215: Curse the highest favours Love lets fall!
2216: Cursed be Hope! Cursed be Faith,                      1605
2217: And cursed be Patience most of all!
2218: 
2219: Choir of Spirits (Unseen)
2220: 
2221: Sorrow! Sorrow!
2222: You’ve destroyed it,
2223: The beautiful world,
2224: With a powerful fist:                                 1610
2225: It tumbles, it’s hurled
2226: To ruin! A demigod crushed it!
2227: We carry
2228: Fragments into the void,
2229: And sadly                                             1615
2230: Lament the Beauty that’s gone.
2231: Stronger
2232: For all of Earth’s sons,
2233: Brighter,
2234: Build it again,                                       1620
2235: Build, in your heart!
2236: Life’s new start,
2237: Begin again,
2238: With senses washed clean,
2239: And sound, then,                                      1625
2240: A newer art!
2241: 
2242: Mephistopheles
2243: 
2244: They’re little, but fine,
2245: These attendants of mine.
2246: Precocious advice they give, listen,
2247: Regarding both action, and passion!                   1630
2248: Into the World outside,
2249: From Solitude, that’s dried
2250: Your sap and senses,
2251: They tempt us.
2252: Stop playing with grief,                              1635
2253: That feeds, a vulture, on your breast,
2254: The worst society, you’ll find, will prompt belief,
2255: That you’re a Man among the rest.
2256: Not that I mean
2257: To shove you into the mass.                  1640
2258: Among ‘the greats’, I’m second-class:
2259: But if you, in my company,
2260: Your path through life would wend,
2261: I’ll willingly condescend
2262: To serve you, as we go.                      1645
2263: I’m your man, and so,
2264: If it suits you of course,
2265: I’m your slave: I’m yours!
2266: 
2267: Faust
2268: 
2269: And what must I do in exchange?
2270: 
2271: Mephistopheles
2272: 
2273: There’s lots of time: you’ve got the gist.   1650
2274: 
2275: Faust
2276: 
2277: No, no! The Devil is an egotist,
2278: Does nothing lightly, or in God’s name,
2279: To help another, so I insist,
2280: Speak your demands out loud,
2281: Such servants are risks, in a house.         1655
2282: 
2283: Mephistopheles
2284: 
2285: I’ll be your servant here, and I’ll
2286: Not stop or rest, at your decree:
2287: When we’re together, on the other side,
2288: You’ll do the same for me.
2289: Faust
2290: 
2291: The ‘other side’ concerns me less:                    1660
2292: Shatter this world, in pieces,
2293: The other one can take its place,
2294: The root of my joy’s on this Earth,
2295: And this Sun lights my sorrow:
2296: If I must part from them tomorrow,                    1665
2297: What can or will be, that I’ll face.
2298: I’ll hear no more of it, of whether
2299: In that future, men both hate and love,
2300: Or whether in those spheres, forever,
2301: We’re given a below and an above.                     1670
2302: 
2303: Mephistopheles
2304: 
2305: In that case, you can venture all.
2306: Commit yourself: today, you shall
2307: View my arts with joy: I mean
2308: To show you what no man has seen.
2309: 
2310: Faust
2311: 
2312: Poor devil what can you give? When has ever           1675
2313: A human spirit, in its highest endeavour,
2314: Been understood by such a one as you?
2315: You have a never-satiating food,
2316: You have your restless gold, a slew
2317: Of quicksilver, melting in the hand,                  1680
2318: Games whose prize no man can land,
2319: A girl, who while she’s on my arm,
2320: Snares a neighbour, with her eyes:
2321: And Honour’s fine and godlike charm,
2322: That, like a meteor, dies?                            1685
2323: Show me fruits then that rot, before they’re ready.
2324: And trees grown green again, each day, too!
2325: Mephistopheles
2326: 
2327: Such commands don’t frighten me:
2328: With such treasures I can truly serve you.
2329: Still, my good friend, a time may come,         1690
2330: When one prefers to eat what’s good in peace.
2331: 
2332: Faust
2333: 
2334: When I lie quiet in bed, at ease.
2335: Then let my time be done!
2336: If you fool me, with flatteries,
2337: Till my own self’s a joy to me,                 1695
2338: If you snare me with luxury –
2339: Let that be the last day I see!
2340: That bet I’ll make!
2341: 
2342: Mephistopheles
2343:                     Done!
2344: 
2345: Faust
2346:                      And quickly!
2347: When, to the Moment then, I say:
2348: ‘Ah, stay a while! You are so lovely!’          1700
2349: Then you can grasp me: then you may,
2350: Then, to my ruin, I’ll go gladly!
2351: Then they can ring the passing bell,
2352: Then from your service you are free,
2353: The clocks may halt, the hands be still,        1705
2354: And time be past and done, for me!
2355: 
2356: Mephistopheles
2357: 
2358: Consider well, we’ll not forget.
2359: Faust
2360: 
2361: You have your rights, complete:
2362: I never over-estimate my powers.
2363: I’ll be a slave, in defeat:                       1710
2364: Why ask whose slave or yours?
2365: 
2366: Mephistopheles
2367: 
2368: Today, likewise, at the Doctors’ Feast
2369: I’ll do my duty as your servant.
2370: One thing, though! – Re: life and death, I want
2371: A few lines from you, at the least.               1715
2372: 
2373: 
2374: Faust
2375: 
2376: You pedant, you demand it now in writing?
2377: You still won’t take Man’s word for anything?
2378: It’s not enough that the things I say,
2379: Will always accord with my future?
2380: The world never ceases to wear away,              1720
2381: And shall a promise bind me, then, forever?
2382: Yet that’s the illusion in our minds,
2383: And who then would be free of it?
2384: Happy the man, who pure truth finds,
2385: And who’ll never deign to sacrifice it!           1725
2386: Still a document, written and signed,
2387: That’s a ghost makes all men fear it.
2388: The word is already dying in the pen,
2389: And wax and leather hold the power then.
2390: What do you want from me base spirit?             1730
2391: Will iron: marble: parchment: paper do it?
2392: Shall I write with stylus, pen or chisel?
2393: I’ll leave the whole decision up to you.
2394: Mephistopheles
2395: 
2396: Why launch into oratory too?
2397: Hot-tempered: you exaggerate as well.       1735
2398: Any bit of paper’s just as good.
2399: And you can sign it with a drop of blood.
2400: 
2401: Faust
2402: 
2403: If it will satisfy you, and it should,
2404: Then let’s complete the farce in full.
2405: 
2406: Mephistopheles
2407: 
2408: Blood is a quite special fluid.             1740
2409: 
2410: Faust
2411: 
2412: Have no fear I’ll break this pact!
2413: The extreme I can promise you: it is
2414: All the power my efforts can extract.
2415: I’ve puffed myself up so highly
2416: I belong in your ranks now.                 1745
2417: The mighty Spirit scorns me
2418: And Nature shuts me out.
2419: The thread of thought has turned to dust,
2420: Knowledge fills me with disgust.
2421: Let the depths of sensuality                1750
2422: Satisfy my burning passion!
2423: And, its impenetrable mask on,
2424: Let every marvel be prepared for me!
2425: Let’s plunge into time’s torrent,
2426: Into the whirlpools of event!               1755
2427: Then let joy, and distress,
2428: Frustration, and success,
2429: Follow each other, as well they can:
2430: Restless activity proves the man!
2431: Mephistopheles
2432: 
2433: No goal or measure’s set for you.            1760
2434: Do as you wish, nibble at everything,
2435: Catch at fragments while you’re flying,
2436: Enjoy it all, whatever you find to do.
2437: Now grab at it, and don’t be stupid!
2438: 
2439: Faust
2440: 
2441: It’s not joy we’re about: you heard it.      1765
2442: I’ll take the frenzy, pain-filled elation,
2443: Loving hatred, enlivening frustration.
2444: Cured of its urge to know, my mind
2445: In future, will not hide from any pain,
2446: And what is shared by all mankind,           1770
2447: In my innermost self, I’ll contain:
2448: My soul will grasp the high and low,
2449: My heart accumulate its bliss and woe,
2450: So this self will embrace all theirs,
2451: That, in the end, their fate it shares.      1775
2452: 
2453: Mephistopheles
2454: 
2455: Believe me, many a thousand year
2456: They’ve chewed hard food, and yet
2457: From the cradle to the bier,
2458: Not one has ever digested it!
2459: Trust one of us, this Whole thing            1780
2460: Was only made for a god’s delight!
2461: In eternal splendour he is dwelling,
2462: He placed us in the darkness quite,
2463: And only gave you day and night.
2464: 
2465: Faust
2466: 
2467: But, I will!                                 1785
2468: Mephistopheles
2469: 
2470:               That’s good to hear!
2471: Yet I’ve a fear, just the one:
2472: Time is short, and art is long.
2473: I think you need instruction.
2474: Join forces with a poet: use poetry,
2475: Let him roam in imagination,                  1790
2476: You’ll gain every noble quality
2477: From your honorary occupation,
2478: The lion’s brave attitude
2479: The wild stag’s swiftness,
2480: The Italian’s fiery blood,                    1795
2481: The North’s persistence.
2482: Let him find the mysterious
2483: Meeting of generous and devious,
2484: While you, with passions young and hot,
2485: Fall in love, according to the plot.          1800
2486: I’d like to see such a gentleman, among us,
2487: And I’d call him Mister Microcosmus.
2488: 
2489: Faust
2490: 
2491: What am I then, if it’s a flight too far,
2492: For me to gain that human crown
2493: I yearn towards with every sense I own?       1805
2494: 
2495: Mephistopheles
2496: 
2497: In the end, you are – what you are.
2498: Set your hair in a thousand curlicues
2499: Place your feet in yard-high shoes,
2500: You’ll remain forever, what you are.
2501: 
2502: Faust
2503: 
2504: All the treasures of the human spirit         1810
2505: I feel that I’ve expended, uselessly.
2506: And wherever, at the last, I sit,
2507: No new power flows, in me.
2508: I’m not a hair’s breadth taller, as you see,
2509: And I’m no nearer to Infinity.                  1815
2510: 
2511: Mephistopheles
2512: 
2513: My dear sir, you see the thing
2514: Exactly as all men see it: why,
2515: We must re-order everything,
2516: Before the joys of life slip by.
2517: Hang it! Hands and feet, belong to you,         1820
2518: Certainly, a head, and a backside,
2519: Yet everything I use as new
2520: Why is my ownership of it denied?
2521: When I can count on six stallions,
2522: Isn’t their horsepower mine to use?             1825
2523: I drive behind, and am a proper man,
2524: As though I’d twenty-four legs, too.
2525: Look lively! Leave the senses be,
2526: And plunge into the world with me!
2527: I say to you that scholarly fellows             1830
2528: Are like the cattle on an arid heath:
2529: Some evil spirit leads them round in circles,
2530: While sweet green meadows lie beneath.
2531: 
2532: Faust
2533: 
2534: How shall we begin then?
2535: 
2536: Mephistopheles
2537: 
2538:              From here, we’ll first win free.
2539: What kind of a martyrs’ hole can this be?       1835
2540: What kind of a teacher of life is he,
2541: Who fills young minds with ennui?
2542: Let your neighbours do it, and go!
2543: Do you want to thresh straw forever?
2544: The best things you can ever know,              1840
2545: You dare not tell the youngsters, ever.
2546: I hear one of them arriving, too!
2547: Faust
2548: 
2549: I’ve no desire to see him, though.
2550: 
2551: Mephistopheles
2552: 
2553: The poor lad’s waited hours for you.
2554: He mustn’t go away un-consoled.                 1845
2555: Come: give me your cap and gown.
2556: The mask should look delicious. So!
2557: 
2558: (He disguises himself.)
2559: 
2560: Now I’ve lost what wit’s my own!
2561: I want fifteen minutes with him, only:
2562: Meanwhile get ready for our journey!            1850
2563: 
2564: (Faust exits.)
2565: 
2566: Mephistopheles (In Faust’s long gown.)
2567: 
2568: Reason and Science you despise,
2569: Man’s highest powers: now the lies
2570: Of the deceiving spirit must bind you
2571: With those magic arts that blind you,
2572: And I’ll have you, totally –                    1855
2573: Fate gave him such a spirit
2574: It urges him ever onwards, wildly,
2575: And, in his hasty striving, he has leapt
2576: Beyond all earth’s ecstasies.
2577: I’ll drag him through raw life,                 1860
2578: Through the meaningless and shallow,
2579: I’ll freeze him: stick to him: keep him ripe,
2580: Frustrate his insatiable greed, allow
2581: Food and drink to drift before his eyes:
2582: In vain he’ll beg for consummation,             1865
2583: And if he weren’t the devil’s, why
2584: He’d still go to his ruination!
2585: 
2586: (A student enters.)
2587: Student
2588: 
2589: I’m only here momentarily,
2590: I’ve come, filled with humility,
2591: To speak to, and to stand before ,                  1870
2592: One who’s spoken of with awe.
2593: 
2594: Mephistopheles
2595: 
2596: Your courtesy delights me greatly!
2597: A man like other men you see.
2598: Have you studied then, elsewhere?
2599: 
2600: Student
2601: 
2602: I beg you, please enrol me, here!                   1875
2603: I come to you strong of courage,
2604: Lined in pocket, healthy for my age:
2605: My mother didn’t want to lose me: though,
2606: I’d like to learn what it’s right for me to know.
2607: 
2608: Mephistopheles
2609: 
2610: Then you’ve come to the right place, exactly.       1880
2611: 
2612: Student
2613: 
2614: To be honest, I’d like to go already:
2615: There’s little pleasure for me at all,
2616: In these walls, and all these halls.
2617: It’s such a narrow space I find,
2618: You see no trees, no leaves of any kind,            1885
2619: And in the lectures, on the benches,
2620: All thought deserts me, and my senses.
2621: Mephistopheles
2622: 
2623: It will only come to you with habit.
2624: So the child takes its mother’s breast
2625: Quite unwillingly at first, and yet it    1890
2626: Soon sucks away at her with zest.
2627: So will you at Wisdom’s breast, here,
2628: Feel every day a little zestier.
2629: 
2630: Student
2631: 
2632: I’ll cling to her neck with pleasure:
2633: But only tell me how to find her.         1895
2634: 
2635: Mephistopheles
2636: 
2637: Explain, before you travel on
2638: What faculty you’ve settled on.
2639: 
2640: Student
2641: 
2642: I want to be a true scholar,
2643: I want to grasp, by the collar,
2644: What’s on earth, in heaven above,         1900
2645: In Science, and in Nature too.
2646: 
2647: Mephistopheles
2648: 
2649: Then here’s the very path for you,
2650: But don’t allow yourself to wander off.
2651: 
2652: Student
2653: 
2654: I’ll be present heart and soul:
2655: Of course I’ll want to play,              1905
2656: Have some fun and freedom, though,
2657: On each sweet summer holiday.
2658: Mephistopheles
2659: 
2660: Use your time well: it slips away so fast, yet
2661: Discipline will teach you how to win it.
2662: My dear friend, I’d advise, in sum,              1910
2663: First, the Collegium Logicum.
2664: There your mind will be trained,
2665: As if in Spanish boots, constrained,
2666: So that painfully, as it ought,
2667: It creeps along the way of thought,              1915
2668: Not flitting about all over,
2669: Wandering here and there.
2670: So you’ll learn, in many days,
2671: What you used to do, untaught, as in a haze,
2672: Like eating now, and drinking, you’ll see        1920
2673: The necessity of One! Two! Three!
2674: Truly the intricacy of logic
2675: Is like a master-weaver’s fabric,
2676: Where the loom holds a thousand threads,
2677: Here and there the shuttles go                   1925
2678: And the threads, invisibly, flow,
2679: One pass serves for a thousand instead.
2680: Then the philosopher steps in: he’ll show
2681: That it certainly had to be so:
2682: The first was - so, the second - so,             1930
2683: And so, the third and fourth were - so:
2684: If first and second had never been,
2685: Third and fourth would not be seen.
2686: All praise the scholars, beyond believing,
2687: But few of them ever turn to weaving.            1935
2688: To know and note the living, you’ll find it
2689: Best to first dispense with the spirit:
2690: Then with the pieces in your hand,
2691: Ah! You’ve only lost the spiritual bond.
2692:  ‘Natural treatment’, Chemistry calls it         1940
2693: Mocks at herself, and doesn’t know it.
2694: Student
2695: 
2696: I’m not sure that I quite understand.
2697: 
2698: Mephistopheles
2699: 
2700: You’ll soon know it all, as planned,
2701: When you’ve learnt the science of reduction,
2702: And everything’s proper classification.        1945
2703: 
2704: Student
2705: 
2706: After all that, I feel as stupid
2707: As if I’d a mill wheel in my head.
2708: 
2709: Mephistopheles
2710: 
2711: Next, before all else, you’ll fix
2712: Your mind on Metaphysics!
2713: See that you’re profoundly trained             1950
2714: In what never stirs in a human brain:
2715: You’ll learn a splendid word
2716: For what’s occurred or not occurred.
2717: But for the present take six months
2718: To get yourself in order: start at once.       1955
2719: Five hours every day, lock
2720: Yourself in, with a ticking clock!
2721: Make sure you’re well prepared,
2722: Study each paragraph with care,
2723: So afterwards you’ll be certain                1960
2724: Only what’s in the book, was written:
2725: Then be as diligent when you pen it,
2726: As if the Holy Ghost had said it!
2727: Student
2728: 
2729: You won’t need to tell me twice!
2730: I think, myself, it’s very helpful, too     1965
2731: That one can take back home, and use,
2732: What someone’s penned in black and white.
2733: 
2734: Mephistopheles
2735: 
2736: But choose a faculty, any one!
2737: 
2738: Student
2739: 
2740: I wouldn’t be comfortable with Law.
2741: 
2742: Mephistopheles
2743: 
2744: I couldn’t name you anything more           1970
2745: Vile, I know how dogmatic it’s become.
2746: Laws and rights are handed down
2747: It’s an eternal disgrace:
2748: They’re moved round from town to town
2749: Dragged around from place to place.         1975
2750: Reason is nonsense, kindness a disease,
2751: If you’re a grandchild it’s a curse!
2752: The rights we are born with,
2753: To those, alas, no one refers!
2754: 
2755: Student
2756: 
2757: That just strengthens my disgust.           1980
2758: Happy the student that you instruct!
2759: I’ve nearly settled on Theology.
2760: Mephistopheles
2761: 
2762: I wouldn’t wish to guide you erroneously.
2763: In what that branch of knowledge concerns
2764: It’s so difficult to avoid a fallacious route,       1985
2765: There’s so much poison hidden in what you learn,
2766: And it’s barely distinguishable from the antidote.
2767: The best thing here’s to make a single choice,
2768: Then simply swear by your master’s voice.
2769: On the whole, to words stick fast!                   1990
2770: Through the safest gate you’ll pass
2771: To the Temple of Certainty.
2772: 
2773: Student
2774: 
2775: Yet surely words must have a sense.
2776: 
2777: Mephistopheles
2778: 
2779: Why, yes! But don’t torment yourself with worry,
2780: Where sense fails it’s only necessary                1995
2781: To supply a word, and change the tense.
2782: With words fine arguments can be weighted,
2783: With words whole Systems can be created,
2784: With words, the mind does its conceiving,
2785: No word suffers a jot from thieving.                 2000
2786: 
2787: Student
2788: 
2789: Forgive me, I delay you with my questions,
2790: But I must trouble you again,
2791: On the subject of Medicine,
2792: Have you no helpful word to say?
2793: Three years, so little time applied,                 2005
2794: And, God, the field is rather wide!
2795: If only you had some kind of pointer,
2796: You would feel so much further on.
2797: Mephistopheles (Aside.)
2798: 
2799: I’m tired of this desiccated banter
2800: I really must play the devil, at once.               2010
2801: 
2802: (Aloud.)
2803: 
2804: To grasp the spirit of Medicine’s easily done:
2805: You study the great and little world, until,
2806: In the end you let it carry on
2807: Just as God wills.
2808: Useless to roam round, scientifically:               2015
2809: Everyone learns only what he can:
2810: The one who grasps the Moment fully,
2811: He’s the proper man.
2812: You’re quite a well-made fellow,
2813: You’re not short of courage too,                     2020
2814: And when you’re easy with yourself,
2815: Others will be easy with you.
2816: Study, especially, female behaviour:
2817: Their eternal aches and woes,
2818: All of the thousand-fold,                            2025
2819: Rise from one point, and have one cure.
2820: And if you’re half honourable about it
2821: You shall have them in your pocket.
2822: A title first: to give them comfort you
2823: Have skills that far exceed the others,              2030
2824: Then you’re free to touch the goods, and view
2825: What someone else has prowled around for years.
2826: Take the pulse firmly, you understand,
2827: And then, with sidelong fiery glance,
2828: Grasp the slender hips, in haste,                    2035
2829: To find out whether she’s tight-laced.
2830: 
2831: Student
2832: 
2833: That sounds much better! The Where and How, I see.
2834: Mephistopheles
2835: 
2836: Grey, dear friend, is all theory,
2837: And green the golden tree of life.
2838: 
2839: Student
2840: 
2841: I swear it’s like a dream to me: may I                             2040
2842: Trouble you, at some further time,
2843: To expound your wisdom, so sublime?
2844: 
2845: Mephistopheles
2846: 
2847: As much as I can, I’ll gladly explain.
2848: 
2849: Student
2850: 
2851: I can’t tear myself away,
2852: I must just pass you my album, sir,                                2045
2853: Grant me the favour of your signature!
2854: 
2855: Mephistopheles
2856: 
2857: Very well.
2858: 
2859: (He writes and gives the book back.)
2860: 
2861: Student (Reading Mephistopheles’ Latin inscription which means: ‘You’ll
2862: be like God, acquainted with good and evil’.)
2863: 
2864: Eritis sicut Deus, scientes bonum et malum.
2865: 
2866: (He makes his bows, and takes his leave.)
2867: 
2868: Mephistopheles
2869: 
2870: Just follow the ancient text, and my mother the snake, too:
2871: And then your likeness to God will surely frighten you!            2050
2872: (Faust enters.)
2873: 
2874: Faust
2875: 
2876: Where will we go, then?
2877: 
2878: Mephistopheles
2879: 
2880:                             Where you please.
2881: The little world, and then the great, we’ll see.
2882: With what profit and delight,
2883: This term, you’ll be a parasite!
2884: 
2885: Faust
2886: 
2887: Yet with my long beard, I’ll                               2055
2888: Lack life’s superficial style.
2889: My attempt will come to nothing:
2890: I know, in this world, I don’t fit in.
2891: I feel so small next to other men,
2892: It only means embarrassment.                               2060
2893: 
2894: Mephistopheles
2895: 
2896: My friend, just give yourself completely to it:
2897: When you find yourself, you’ll soon know how to live it.
2898: 
2899: Faust
2900: 
2901: How shall we depart from here, then?
2902: I see not one servant, coach, or horse.
2903: 
2904: Mephistopheles
2905: 
2906: We’ll just spread this cloak wide open,                    2065
2907: Then through the air we’ll take our course.
2908: For a daring trip like this we’re on,
2909: Better not take much baggage along.
2910: A little hot air I’ll ready, first,
2911: To lift us nimbly above the Earth,         2070
2912: And as we’re light we’ll soon get clear:
2913: Congratulations on your new career!
2914: Part I Scene V: Auerbach’s Cellar in Leipzig
2915: 
2916: (Friends happily drinking.)
2917: 
2918: Frosch
2919: 
2920: Will none of you laugh? Nobody drink?
2921: I’ll have to teach you to smile, I think!
2922: You’re all of you like wet straw today,                 2075
2923: And usually you’re well away.
2924: 
2925: Brander
2926: 
2927: That’s up to you, you bring us nothing.
2928: Nothing dumb, or dirty, nothing.
2929: 
2930: Frosch (Pouring a glass of wine over Brander’s head.)
2931: 
2932: You can have both!
2933: 
2934: Brander
2935:                           Rotten swine!
2936: 
2937: Frosch
2938: 
2939: You wanted them both, so you got mine!                  2080
2940: 
2941: Siebel
2942: 
2943: Out the door, whoever fights! Get out!
2944: Let’s sing a heart-felt chorus, drink and shout!
2945: Up! Hurray! Ha!
2946: 
2947: Altmayer
2948: 
2949:                          Ah! I’m in agony!
2950: Earplugs, here! This fellow’s deafened me.
2951: Siebel
2952: 
2953: It’s only when it echoes in the tower,       2085
2954: You hear a bass voice’s real power.
2955: 
2956: Frosch
2957: 
2958: Right, out with him who takes offence!
2959: Ah! Do, re, me!
2960: 
2961: Altmayer
2962: 
2963:                    Ah! Do, re, me!
2964: 
2965: Fosch
2966: 
2967: Our throats are tuned: commence.
2968: 
2969: (He sings.)
2970: 
2971: ‘Dear Holy Roman Empire,                     2090
2972: How do you hold together?’
2973: 
2974: Brander
2975: 
2976: A lousy song! Bah! A political song -
2977: A tiresome song! Thank God, every morning,
2978: It isn’t you who must sit there worrying
2979: About the Empire! At least I’m better for    2095
2980: Not being a King or a Chancellor.
2981: But we should have a leader, so
2982: We’ll choose a Pope of our own.
2983: You know the qualities that can
2984: Swing the vote, and elevate the man.         2100
2985: 
2986: Frosch (Sings.)
2987: 
2988: ‘Sing away, sweet Nightingale,
2989: Greet my girl, and never fail.’
2990: Siebel
2991: 
2992: Don’t greet my girl! I’ll not allow it!
2993: 
2994: Frosch
2995: 
2996: Greet and kiss her! You’ll not stop it!
2997: 
2998: (He sings.)
2999: 
3000: ‘Slip the bolt in deepest night!                  2105
3001: Slip it! Wake, the lover bright.
3002: Slip it to! At break of dawn.’
3003: 
3004: Siebel
3005: 
3006: Yes, sing in praise of her, and boast: sing on!
3007: I’ll laugh later when it suits:
3008: She leads me a dance, she’ll lead you too.        2110
3009: She should have a dwarf for a lover!
3010: At the crossroads, let him woo her:
3011: An old goat from Blocksberg, galloping over,
3012: Can bleat goodnight, as it passes by her.
3013: An honest man, of flesh and blood,                2115
3014: For a girl like that’s far too good.
3015: I’m not bothered even to say hello
3016: Except perhaps to break her window.
3017: 
3018: Brander (Pounding on the table.)
3019: 
3020: Quiet! Quiet! Or you won’t hear!
3021: I know about life, you lot, confess.              2120
3022: Besotted persons sit among us,
3023: As fits their status, then, I must
3024: Give them, tonight, of my very best.
3025: Listen! A song in the newest strain!
3026: And you can shout out the refrain!                2125
3027: 
3028: (He sings.)
3029: ‘Once there was a cellar rat,
3030: Who lived on grease, and butter:
3031: He had a belly, round and fat,
3032: Just like Doctor Luther.
3033: The cook set poison round about:        2130
3034: It brought on such a violent bout,
3035: As if he’d love inside him.’
3036: 
3037: Chorus (Shouting.)
3038: 
3039: ‘As if he’d love inside him!’
3040: 
3041: Brander
3042: 
3043: ‘He ran here, and he ran there,
3044: And drank from all the puddles,         2135
3045: Gnawing, scratching, everywhere,
3046: But nothing cured his shudders.
3047: In torment, he leapt to the roof,
3048: Poor beast, soon he’d had enough,
3049: As if he’d love inside him.’            2140
3050: 
3051: Chorus
3052: 
3053: ‘As if he’d love inside him!’
3054: 
3055: Brander
3056: 
3057: ‘Fear drove him to the light of day,
3058: Into the kitchen then he ran,
3059: Fell on the hearth and twitched away,
3060: Pitifully weak, and wan.                2145
3061: Then the murderess laughed with glee:
3062: He’s on his last legs, I see,
3063: As if he’d love inside him.’
3064: 
3065: Chorus
3066: 
3067: ‘As if he’d love inside him.’
3068: Siebel
3069: 
3070: How pleased they are, the tiresome fools!   2150
3071: Spreading poison for wretched rats,
3072: To me, that’s the right thing to do!
3073: 
3074: Brander
3075: 
3076: You’re in sympathy with them, perhaps?
3077: 
3078: Altmayer
3079: 
3080: That fat belly with a balding head!
3081: Bad luck makes him meek and mild:           2155
3082: From a swollen rat, he sees, with dread,
3083: His own natural likeness is compiled.
3084: 
3085: (Faust and Mephistopheles appear.)
3086: 
3087: First of all, I had to bring you here,
3088: Where cheerful friends sup together,
3089: To see how happily life slips away.         2160
3090: For these folk every day’s a holiday.
3091: With lots of leisure, and little sense,
3092: They revolve in their round-dance,
3093: Chasing their tails as kittens prance,
3094: If the hangovers aren’t too intense,        2165
3095: If the landlord gives them credit,
3096: They’re cheerful, and unworried by it.
3097: 
3098: Brander
3099: 
3100: They’re fresh from their travelling days,
3101: You can tell by their foreign ways:
3102: They’ve not been back an hour: you see.     2170
3103: Frosch
3104: 
3105: True, you’re right! My Leipzig’s dear to me!
3106: It’s a little Paris, and educates its people.
3107: 
3108: Siebel
3109: 
3110: Who do you think the strangers are?
3111: 
3112: Frosch
3113: 
3114: Let me find out! I’ll draw the truth,
3115: From those two, with a brimming glass,          2175
3116: As easily as you’d pull a child’s tooth.
3117: It seems to me they’re of some noble house,
3118: They look so discontented and so proud.
3119: 
3120: Brander
3121: 
3122: They’re surely strolling players, I’d guess!
3123: 
3124: Altmayer
3125: 
3126: Perhaps.
3127: 
3128: Frosch
3129: 
3130:    Watch me screw it out of them, then!         2180
3131: 
3132: Mephistopheles (To Faust.)
3133: 
3134: These folk wouldn’t feel the devil, even
3135: If he’d got them dangling by the neck.
3136: 
3137: Faust
3138: 
3139: Greetings, sirs!
3140: Siebel
3141: 
3142:                     Thank you, and greetings.
3143: 
3144: (He mutters away, inspecting Mephistopheles side-on.)
3145: 
3146: What’s wrong with his foot: why’s he limping?
3147: 
3148: Mephistopheles
3149: 
3150: Allow us to sit with you, if you please.                2185
3151: Instead of fine ale that can’t be had,
3152: We can still have good company.
3153: 
3154: Altmayer
3155: 
3156: You seem a choosy sort of lad.
3157: 
3158: Frosch
3159: 
3160: Was it late when you started out from Rippach?
3161: Perhaps you dined with Hans there, first?               2190
3162: 
3163: Mephistopheles
3164: 
3165: We passed straight by, today, without a rest!
3166: We spoke to him last some time back,
3167: When he talked a lot about his cousins,
3168: And he sent to each his kind greetings.
3169: 
3170: (He bows to Frosch.)
3171: 
3172: Altmayer (Aside.)
3173: 
3174: He did you, there! He’s smart!
3175: 
3176: Siebel
3177: 
3178:                A shrewd customer!                       2195
3179: Frosch
3180: 
3181: Wait, I’ll have him soon, I’m sure!
3182: 
3183: Mephistopheles
3184: 
3185: If I’m not wrong, we heard
3186: A tuneful choir singing?
3187: I’m sure, with this vault, the words
3188: Must really set it ringing!                              2200
3189: 
3190: Frosch
3191: 
3192: Are you by any chance a virtuoso?
3193: 
3194: Mephistopheles
3195: 
3196: No! Though my desire is great, my skill is only so-so.
3197: 
3198: Altmayer
3199: 
3200: Give us a song!
3201: 
3202: Mephistopheles
3203: 
3204:               If you wish it, a few.
3205: 
3206: Siebel
3207: 
3208: So long as it’s a brand-new one!
3209: 
3210: Mephistopheles
3211: 
3212: Well, it’s from Spain that we’ve just come,              2205
3213: The lovely land of wine, and singing too.
3214: 
3215: (He sings.)
3216: 
3217: ‘There was once a king, who
3218: Had a giant flea’ –
3219: Frosch
3220: 
3221: Listen! Did you get that? A flea.
3222: A flea’s an honest guest to me.            2210
3223: 
3224: Mephistopheles (Sings.)
3225: 
3226: ‘There was once a king, who
3227: Had a giant flea,
3228: He loved him very much, oh,
3229: He was like a son, you see.
3230: The king called for his tailor,            2215
3231: He came right away:
3232: Now, measure up the lad for
3233: A suit of clothes, I say!’
3234: 
3235: Brander
3236: 
3237: Make sure the tailor’s sharp,
3238: And cuts them out precisely,               2220
3239: And, since his son’s dear to his heart,
3240: Make sure there’s never a crease to see.
3241: 
3242: Mephistopheles
3243: 
3244: ‘All in silk and velvet,
3245: He was smartly dressed,
3246: With ribbons on his coat,                  2225
3247: A cross upon his chest.
3248: He was the First Minister,
3249: And so he wore a star:
3250: His brothers and his sisters,
3251: He made noblest by far.                    2230
3252: The lords and the ladies,
3253: They were badly smitten,
3254: The Queen and her maids,
3255: They were stung and bitten.
3256: They didn’t dare to crush them,                   2235
3257: Or scratch away, all night.
3258: We smother them, and crush them,
3259: The moment that they bite.’
3260: 
3261: Chorus (Shouted.)
3262: 
3263: ‘We smother them, and crush them,
3264: The moment that they bite.’                       2240
3265: 
3266: Frosch
3267: 
3268: Bravo! Bravo! That went sweetly!
3269: 
3270: Siebel
3271: 
3272: So shall it be with every flea!
3273: 
3274: Brander
3275: 
3276: Sharpen your nails, and crush them fine!
3277: 
3278: Altmayer
3279: 
3280: Long live freedom, and long live wine!
3281: 
3282: Mephistopheles
3283: 
3284: I’d love to drink a glass, in freedom’s honour,   2245
3285: If only the wine were a little better.
3286: 
3287: Siebel
3288: 
3289: Not again, we don’t want to hear!
3290: Mephistopheles
3291: 
3292: I fear the landlord might complain
3293: Or I’d give these worthy guests,
3294: One of my cellar’s very best.                      2250
3295: 
3296: Siebel
3297: 
3298: Just bring it on! He’ll accept it: I’ll explain.
3299: 
3300: Frosch
3301: 
3302: Make it a good glass and we’ll praise it.
3303: But don’t make it so small we can’t taste it.
3304: Because if I’m truly going to decide,
3305: I need a really big mouthful inside.               2255
3306: 
3307: Altmayer (Aside.)
3308: 
3309: They’re from the Rhine, as I guessed.
3310: 
3311: Mephistopheles
3312: 
3313: Bring me a corkscrew!
3314: 
3315: Brander
3316: 
3317:                       What for?
3318: Is it outside already, this cask?
3319: 
3320: Altmayer
3321: 
3322: There’s one in the landlord’s toolbox, for sure.
3323: 
3324: Mephistopheles (Takes the corkscrew. To Frosch.)
3325: 
3326: Now, what would you like to try?                   2260
3327: Frosch
3328: 
3329: What? Is there a selection, too?
3330: 
3331: Mephistopheles
3332: 
3333: There’s a choice for every one of you.
3334: 
3335: Altmayer (To Frosch.)
3336: 
3337: Ah! You soon catch on: your lips are dry?
3338: 
3339: Frosch
3340: 
3341: Good! When I’ve a choice, I drink Rhenish.
3342: The Fatherland grants those best gifts to us.                        2265
3343: 
3344: Mephistopheles (Boring a hole in the table-edge where Frosch is sitting.)
3345: 
3346: Bring me a little wax, to make the seals, as well!
3347: 
3348: Altmayer
3349: 
3350: Ah, that’s for the conjuring trick, I can tell.
3351: 
3352: Mephistopheles (To Brander.)
3353: 
3354: And yours?
3355: 
3356: Brander
3357: 
3358:    Champagne for me is fine:
3359: Make it a truly sparkling wine!
3360: 
3361: (Mephistopheles bores the holes: one of the others makes the wax stoppers
3362: and stops the holes with them.)
3363: We can’t always shun what’s foreign,                2270
3364: Things from far away are often fine.
3365: Real Germans can’t abide a Frenchman,
3366: And yet they gladly drink his wine.
3367: 
3368: Siebel (As Mephistopheles approaches his seat.)
3369: 
3370: I must confess I do dislike the dry,
3371: Give me a glass of the very sweetest!               2275
3372: 
3373: Mephistopheles (Boring a hole.)
3374: 
3375: I’ll pour an instant Tokay for you, yes?
3376: 
3377: Altmayer
3378: 
3379: Now, gentlemen, look me in the eye!
3380: I see you’ve had the better of us there.
3381: 
3382: Mephistopheles
3383: 
3384: Now! Now! With guests so rare,
3385: That would be far too much for me to dare.          2280
3386: Quick! Time for you to declare!
3387: Which wine can I serve you with?
3388: 
3389: Altmayer
3390: 
3391: Any at all! Don’t make us ask forever.
3392: 
3393: (Now all the holes have been stopped and sealed.)
3394: Mephistopheles (With a strange gesture.)
3395: 
3396: Grapes, they are the vine’s load!
3397: Horns, they are the he-goat’s:                                        2285
3398: Wine is juice: wood makes vines,
3399: The wooden board shall give us wine.
3400: Look deeper into Nature!
3401: Have faith, and here’s a wonder!
3402: Now draw the stoppers, and drink up!                                  2290
3403: 
3404: All (Draw the stoppers, and the wine they chose flows into each glass.)
3405: 
3406: O lovely fount, that flows for us!
3407: 
3408: Mephistopheles
3409: 
3410: But careful, don’t lose a drop!
3411: 
3412: (They drink repeatedly.)
3413: 
3414: All (Singing.)
3415: 
3416: ‘We’re all of us cannibals now,
3417: We’re like five hundred sows.’
3418: 
3419: Mephistopheles
3420: 
3421: The folk are free, and we can go, you see!                            2295
3422: 
3423: Faust
3424: 
3425: I’d like to leave here now.
3426: 
3427: Mephistopheles
3428: 
3429: Watch first: their bestiality
3430: Will make a splendid show.
3431: Siebel
3432: 
3433: (He drinks carelessly, wine pours on the ground and bursts into flame.)
3434: 
3435: Help! Fire! Hell burns bright!
3436: 
3437: Mephistopheles (Charming away the flame.)
3438: 
3439: Friendly element, be quiet!                                           2300
3440: 
3441: (To the drinkers.)
3442: 
3443: For this time, just a drop of Purgatory.
3444: 
3445: Siebel
3446: 
3447: What’s that? You wait! You’ll pay dearly!
3448: It seems you don’t quite see us right.
3449: 
3450: Frosch
3451: 
3452: Try playing that trick a second time, on us!
3453: 
3454: Altmayer
3455: 
3456: I think we should quietly send him packing.                           2305
3457: 
3458: Siebel
3459: 
3460: What, sir? You think you’re daring,
3461: Tricking us with your hocus-pocus?
3462: 
3463: Mephistopheles
3464: 
3465: Be quiet, old wine-barrel!
3466: 
3467: Siebel
3468: 
3469: You broomstick! You’ll show us you’re ill bred?
3470: Brander
3471: 
3472: Just wait, it’ll rain blows, on your head!                2310
3473: 
3474: Altmayer (Draws a stopper and fire blazes in his face.)
3475: 
3476: I’m burning! Burning!
3477: 
3478: Siebel
3479: 
3480:                        It’s magic, strike!
3481: The man’s a rascal! Kick him as you like!
3482: 
3483: (They draw knives and rush at Mephistopheles.)
3484: 
3485: Mephistopheles (With solemn gestures.)
3486: 
3487: Word and Image, ensnare!
3488: Alter, senses and air!
3489: Be here, and there!                                       2315
3490: 
3491: 
3492: (They look at each other, amazed.)
3493: 
3494: Altmayer
3495: 
3496: Where am I? What a lovely land!
3497: 
3498: Frosch
3499: 
3500: Vineyards? Am I seeing straight?
3501: 
3502: Siebel
3503: 
3504: And, likewise, grapes to hand!
3505: Brander
3506: 
3507: Deep in this green arbour, here,
3508: See, the vines! What grapes appear!
3509: 
3510: (He grasps Siebel by the nose: the others do the same reciprocally, and raise
3511: their knives.)
3512: 
3513: Mephistopheles
3514: 
3515: From their eyes, Error, take the iron band,                           2320
3516: And let them see how the Devil plays a joke.
3517: 
3518: (He vanishes with Faust: the revellers separate.)
3519: 
3520: Siebel
3521: 
3522: What’s happening?
3523: 
3524: Altmayer
3525:                    And how?
3526: 
3527: Frosch
3528:                                 Was that your nose?
3529: 
3530: Brander (To Siebel.)
3531: 
3532: And I’ve still got your nose in my hand!
3533: 
3534: Altmayer
3535: 
3536: It was a tremor, that passed through every limb!
3537: Pass me a stool: I’m sinking in!                                      2325
3538: 
3539: Frosch
3540: 
3541: Tell me: what happened there, my friend?
3542: Siebel
3543: 
3544: Where is he? When I catch that fellow,
3545: He won’t leave here alive again!
3546: 
3547: Altmayer
3548: 
3549: I saw him myself fly out of the cellar
3550: Riding on a barrel – and then –                    2330
3551: I feel there’s lead still in my feet.
3552: 
3553: (He turns towards the table.)
3554: 
3555: Ah! Does the wine still flow as sweet?
3556: 
3557: Siebel
3558: 
3559: It was deception, cheating, lying.
3560: 
3561: Frosch
3562: 
3563: Still, it seemed that I drank wine.
3564: 
3565: Brander
3566: 
3567: And what about all those grapes that hung there?   2335
3568: 
3569: Altmayer
3570: 
3571: Tell me, now, we shouldn’t believe in wonders!
3572: Part I Scene VI: The Witches’ Kitchen
3573: 
3574: (A giant cauldron stands on a low hearth, with a fire under it. Various
3575: shapes appear in the fumes from the cauldron. A She-Ape sits next to it,
3576: skimming it, watching to see it doesn’t boil over. The He-Ape, with young
3577: ones, sits nearby warming himself. The ceiling and walls are covered with
3578: the Witches’ grotesque instruments.)
3579: 
3580: Faust
3581: 
3582: These magical wild beasts repel me, too!
3583: Are you telling me I can be renewed,
3584: Wandering around in this mad maze,
3585: Demanding help from some old hag:                                    2340
3586: That her foul cookery will spirit away
3587: Thirty years from my age, just like that?
3588: It’s sad, if you know of nothing better!
3589: The star of hope has quickly set.
3590: Hasn’t some noble mind, or Nature,                                   2345
3591: Found some wondrous potion yet?
3592: 
3593: Mephistopheles
3594: 
3595: My friend, what you say, again, is intelligent!
3596: There’s a natural means to make you younger:
3597: But it’s written, in a book quite different,
3598: And in an odd chapter.                                               2350
3599: 
3600: Faust
3601: 
3602: I’ll know it, then.
3603: 
3604: Mephistopheles
3605: 
3606: Fine! You’ve a method here that needs
3607: No gold, no doctor, no magician:
3608: Take yourself off to the nearest field,
3609: To scratch around, and hoe, and dig in,
3610: Maintain yourself, and constrain                                     2355
3611: Your senses in a narrow sphere:
3612: Feed yourself on the purest fare,
3613: Be a beast among beasts: think it no robbery,
3614: To manure the fields you harvest, there:
3615: Since that’s the best of ways, believe me,      2360
3616: To keep your youth for eighty years!
3617: 
3618: Faust
3619: 
3620: I’m not used to it, can’t condescend,
3621: To take a spade in hand, and bend:
3622: That narrow life wouldn’t suit me at all.
3623: 
3624: Mephistopheles
3625: 
3626: So you must call the witch then, after all.     2365
3627: 
3628: Faust
3629: 
3630: Why is that old witch necessary!
3631: Why can’t you, yourself, make the brew?
3632: 
3633: Mephistopheles
3634: 
3635: What a lovely occupation for me!
3636: And build a thousand bridges, meanwhile, too.
3637: It’s not just art and science that tell,        2370
3638: Patience is needed in the work as well.
3639: A calm mind’s busy years in its creation,
3640: Only time strengthens the fermentation.
3641: And everything about it
3642: Is quite a peculiar show!                       2375
3643: It’s true the Devil taught it:
3644: The Devil can’t make it though.
3645: 
3646: (Seeing the creatures.)
3647: 
3648: See what a dainty race I hail!
3649: This is the female: this is the male!
3650: (To the creatures.)
3651: 
3652: The mistress isn’t home, I say?                2380
3653: 
3654: The Creatures
3655: 
3656: Feasting away,
3657: Gone today,
3658: The Chimney way!
3659: 
3660: Mephistopheles
3661: 
3662: How long will she be swarming?
3663: 
3664: The Creatures
3665: 
3666: As long as our paws are warming.               2385
3667: 
3668: Mephistopheles (To Faust.)
3669: 
3670: What do you think of these tender creatures?
3671: 
3672: Faust
3673: 
3674: As rude as any I ever saw!
3675: 
3676: Mephistopheles
3677: 
3678: Ah, but to me this kind of discourse
3679: Shows the most delightful features!
3680: 
3681: (To the creatures.)
3682: 
3683: Accursed puppets, tell me true,                2390
3684: What are you stirring in that brew?
3685: 
3686: The Creatures
3687: 
3688: We’re cooking up thick beggars’ soup.
3689: Mephistopheles
3690: 
3691: Then there’ll be thousands in the queue.
3692: 
3693: The He-Ape (Approaches and fawns on Mephistopheles.)
3694: 
3695: O, throw the dice quick,
3696: And let me be rich!                                                 2395
3697: I’ll be the winner!
3698: It’s all arranged badly,
3699: And if I had money,
3700: I’d be a thinker.
3701: 
3702: Mephistopheles
3703: 
3704: Why does the ape think he’d be lucky,                               2400
3705: If he’d only a chance to try the lottery!
3706: 
3707: (Meanwhile the young apes have been playing with a large ball, and they
3708: roll it forward.)
3709: 
3710: The He-Ape
3711: 
3712: The world’s a ball
3713: It lifts to fall,
3714: Rolls without rest:
3715: Rings like glass,                                                   2405
3716: And breaks as fast!
3717: It’s hollow at best.
3718: It’s shining here,
3719: Here, what’s more:
3720: ‘I am living!’                                                      2410
3721: A place dear son,
3722: To keep far from!
3723: You must die!
3724: Its clay will soon
3725: In pieces, lie.                                                     2415
3726: Mephistopheles
3727: 
3728: Why the sieve?
3729: 
3730: The He-Ape (Lifting it down.)
3731: 
3732: If you were a thief
3733: I’d know you this minute.
3734: 
3735: (He runs to the She-Ape, and lets her look through the sieve.)
3736: 
3737: Look through the sieve!                                          2420
3738: Can you see the thief,
3739: But daren’t name him?
3740: 
3741: Mephistopheles (Approaching the fire.)
3742: 
3743: And this pot?
3744: 
3745: The He-Ape and She-Ape
3746: 
3747: What a silly lot!
3748: Not to know a pot,
3749: Not to know a kettle!                                            2425
3750: 
3751: Mephistopheles
3752: 
3753: Rude creature!
3754: 
3755: The He-Ape
3756: 
3757: Take this brush here,
3758: And sit on the settle.
3759: 
3760: (He invites Mephistopheles to sit down.)
3761: Faust (Who all this time has been standing in front of a mirror, alternately
3762: approaching it and distancing himself from it.)
3763: 
3764: What do I see? What heavenly form
3765: Is this that the magic mirror brings!                                  2430
3766: Love, lend me your swiftest wings,
3767: Then bear me to fields she adorns!
3768: Ah, if I do not stand still here,
3769: If I dare to venture nearer,
3770: I see as if through a mist, no clearer –                               2435
3771: The loveliest form of Woman, there!
3772: Is it possible: can Woman be so lovely?
3773: Must I, in her outspread body, declare
3774: The incarnation of all that’s heavenly?
3775: Can any such this earth deliver?                                       2440
3776: 
3777: Mephistopheles
3778: 
3779: Naturally, if a God torments himself six days,
3780: And says to himself, Bravo, at last, in praise,
3781: He must have made something clever.
3782: See, this time, what will satisfy you, forever:
3783: I’ll know how to fish that treasure out for you,                       2445
3784: Happy, the one who finds good fortune in her,
3785: And carries her home again, as his bride, too.
3786: 
3787: (Faust gazes endlessly in the mirror. Mephistopheles stretches himself on the
3788: settle, plays with the brush, and continues to speak.)
3789: 
3790: Here I sit like a king on his throne,
3791: The sceptre’s here, but where’s the crown?
3792: 
3793: The Creatures (Who up till now have been making all kinds of grotesque
3794: movements together, bring Mephistopheles a crown, with great outcry.)
3795: 
3796: Oh, with sweat and with blood,                                         2450
3797: If you’ll be so good,
3798: Glue on this crown, sublime!
3799: (They are awkward with the crown, and snap it in two pieces, with which
3800: they leap about.)
3801: 
3802: Now that’s out of the way!
3803: We see, and we say,
3804: We hear, and we rhyme -                                              2455
3805: 
3806: Faust (In front of the mirror.)
3807: 
3808: Ah! I’ll go completely mad.
3809: 
3810: Mephistopheles (Pointing to the creatures.)
3811: 
3812: Now my head’s almost spinning.
3813: 
3814: The Creatures
3815: 
3816: If our luck’s not bad,
3817: If there’s sense to be had,
3818: We must be thinking!                                                 2460
3819: 
3820: Faust (As before.)
3821: 
3822: My heart pains me with its burning! Quick,
3823: Let’s leave this place, forego it!
3824: 
3825: Mephistopheles (Still in the same position.)
3826: 
3827: Well, at least one must admit
3828: That they’re honest poets.
3829: 
3830: (The cauldron that the She-Ape has forgotten to keep a watch on, now boils
3831: over: a great flame flares from the chimney. The Witch comes careering
3832: down through the flames, with horrendous cries.)
3833: 
3834: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!                                                      2465
3835: Damned creature! Accursed sow!
3836: You left the kettle: you’ve singed me now!
3837: Accursed creature!
3838: (Seeing Faust and Mephistopheles.)
3839: 
3840: What have we here?
3841: Who are you, here?                                                  2470
3842: What do you want?
3843: Who creeps unknown?
3844: The fire’s pain own
3845: In all your bone!
3846: 
3847: (She plunges the skimming-ladle into the cauldron, and scatters flame
3848: towards Faust, Mephistopheles and the Creatures. The Creatures whimper.)
3849: 
3850: Mephistopheles (Reversing the brush he holds in his hand, and striking
3851: among the jars and glasses.)
3852: 
3853: One, two! One, two!
3854: There lies the brew!
3855: There lies the glass!
3856: A joke at last,
3857: In time, she-ass,
3858: To your melody, too.                                                2480
3859: 
3860: (As the Witch starts back in Anger and Horror.)
3861: 
3862: Do you know me? Skeleton! Scarecrow!
3863: Do you know your lord and master?
3864: What stops me from striking you, so,
3865: Crushing you, and your ape-creatures?
3866: Have you no respect for a scarlet coat?                             2485
3867: Don’t you understand a cockerel’s feather?
3868: Have I hidden my face, you old she-goat?
3869: Have I to name myself, as ever?
3870: 
3871: The Witch
3872: 
3873: Oh sir, forgive the rude welcome!
3874: I don’t see a single foot cloven.                                   2490
3875: And your two ravens - are where?
3876: Mephistopheles
3877: 
3878: This once, you get away with it:
3879: It’s truly a good while, isn’t it,
3880: Since we’ve been seen together.
3881: And Civilisation makes men level,            2495
3882: It even sticks to the Devil:
3883: That Northern demon is no more:
3884: Who sees horns now, or tail or claw?
3885: As for the feet, which I can’t spare,
3886: That would harm me with the people.          2500
3887: So like many a youth, now, I wear,
3888: False calves and false in-steps, as well.
3889: 
3890: The Witch (Dancing.)
3891: 
3892: Sense and reason flee my brain,
3893: I see young Satan here again!
3894: 
3895: Mephistopheles
3896: 
3897: Woman, I forbid that name!                   2505
3898: 
3899: The Witch
3900: 
3901: Why? What harm is caused so?
3902: 
3903: Mephistopheles
3904: 
3905: It’s written in story books, always:
3906: Men are no better for it, though:
3907: The Evil One’s gone: the evil stays.
3908: Call me the Baron: that sounds good:         2510
3909: I’m a gentleman, like the other gentlemen.
3910: Perhaps you doubt my noble blood:
3911: See, here’s the crest I carry, then!
3912: 
3913: (He makes an indecent gesture.)
3914: The Witch (Laughing immoderately.)
3915: 
3916: Ha! Ha! That’s your way, as ever.
3917: You’re the same rogue forever!             2515
3918: 
3919: Mephistopheles (To Faust.)
3920: 
3921: My friend, take note: learn that this is
3922: The proper way to handle witches.
3923: 
3924: The Witch
3925: 
3926: Now, gentlemen, say how I can be of use.
3927: 
3928: Mephistopheles
3929: 
3930: A good glass of your well-known juice!
3931: But I must insist on the oldest:           2520
3932: The years double what it can do.
3933: 
3934: The Witch
3935: 
3936: Gladly! Here’s a flask, on the shelf:
3937: I sometimes drink from it myself,
3938: And it doesn’t really stink at all:
3939: I’ll gladly give him a glass or so.        2525
3940: 
3941: (Whispering.)
3942: 
3943: If he drinks it unprepared, recall,
3944: He won’t live a single hour, though.
3945: 
3946: Mephistopheles
3947: 
3948: He’s my good friend: it’ll go down well:
3949: Don’t begrudge the best of your kitchen.
3950: Draw the circle: speak the speech, then    2530
3951: Offer him a glass full!
3952: (The Witch draws a circle with fantastic gestures, and places mysterious
3953: articles inside it: meanwhile the glasses start to ring, and the cauldron to
3954: echo, and make music. Finally she brings a large book, sits the Apes in a
3955: ring, who serve as a reading desk and hold torches. She beckons Faust to
3956: approach.)
3957: 
3958: Faust (To Mephistopheles.)
3959: 
3960: Tell me, now, what’s happening?
3961: These wild gestures, crazy things,
3962: All of this tasteless trickery,
3963: Is known, and hateful enough to me.                                      2535
3964: 
3965: Mephistopheles
3966: 
3967: A farce! You should be laughing:
3968: Don’t be such a serious fellow!
3969: This hocus-pocus she, the doctor’s, making,
3970: So you’ll be aided by the juice to follow.
3971: 
3972: (He persuades Faust to enter the circle.)
3973: 
3974: The Witch (Begins to declaim from the book, with much emphasis.)
3975: 
3976: You shall see, then!                                                     2540
3977: From one make ten!
3978: Let two go again,
3979: Make three even,
3980: You’re rich again.
3981: Take away four!                                                          2545
3982: From five and six,
3983: So says the Witch,
3984: Make seven and eight,
3985: So it’s full weight:
3986: And nine is one,                                                         2550
3987: And ten is none.
3988: This is the Witch’s one-times-one!
3989: Faust
3990: 
3991: I’m in the dark, the hag babbles with fever.
3992: 
3993: Mephistopheles
3994: 
3995: There’s still more she’s not gone over,
3996: I know it well, the whole book’s like this:    2555
3997: I’ve wasted time on it before, though,
3998: A perfect contradiction in terms is
3999: Ever a mystery to the wise: fools more so.
4000: My friend, the art’s both old and new,
4001: It’s like this in every age, with two          2560
4002: And one, and one and two,
4003: Scattering error instead of truth.
4004: Men prattle, and teach it undisturbed:
4005: Who wants to be counted with the fools?
4006: Men always believe, when they hear words,      2565
4007: There must be thought behind them, too.
4008: 
4009: The Witch (Continuing.)
4010: 
4011: The highest skill,
4012: The science, still
4013: Is hidden from the rabble!
4014: One who never thought,                         2570
4015: To him it’s brought,
4016: He owns it without trouble.
4017: 
4018: Faust
4019: 
4020: Why talk this nonsense to us?
4021: My head’s near split in two.
4022: It seems I hear the chorus,                    2575
4023: Of a hundred thousand fools.
4024: Mephistopheles
4025: 
4026: Enough, enough, O excellent Sibyl!
4027: Bring the drink along: and fill
4028: The cup, quick, to the very brim:
4029: The drink will bring my friend no harm:                                2580
4030: He’s a man of many parts, and him
4031: Many a noble draught has charmed.
4032: 
4033: (The Witch, ceremoniously, pours the drink into a cup: as Faust puts it to his
4034: lips, a gentle flame rises.)
4035: 
4036: Down it quickly! Every time! It’ll
4037: Likewise, warm your heart, entire.
4038: You’re hand in hand with the Devil:                                    2585
4039: Will you shrink before the fire?
4040: 
4041: (The Witch breaks the circle. Faust steps out.)
4042: 
4043: Now, quick, away! You may not rest.
4044: 
4045: The Witch
4046: 
4047: Much good may that potion do you!
4048: 
4049: Mephistopheles (To the Witch.)
4050: 
4051: On Walpurgis Night you can tell me best,
4052: What favour I can return to you.                                       2590
4053: 
4054: The Witch
4055: 
4056: Here’s a song! Sing it sometimes, and you,
4057: Will feel a peculiar effect: don’t ask me how.
4058: 
4059: Mephistopheles (To Faust.)
4060: 
4061: Come on, quickly, run about now:
4062: You need to sweat, that will allow
4063: The power to penetrate, through and through.                           2595
4064: Later, I’ll teach you to value leisure,
4065: And soon you’ll find with deepest pleasure,
4066: How Cupid stirs, and, now and then, leaps, too.
4067: 
4068: Faust
4069: 
4070: Let me look quickly in the glass, once more!
4071: How lovely that woman’s form, I descried!         2600
4072: 
4073: Mephistopheles
4074: 
4075: No! No! The paragon of all women, you’re
4076: About to see before you, personified.
4077: 
4078: (Aside.)
4079: 
4080: With that drink in your body, well then,
4081: All women will look to you like Helen.
4082: Part I Scene VII: A Street
4083: 
4084: (Faust. Margaret, passing by.)
4085: 
4086: Faust
4087: 
4088: Lovely lady, may I offer you               2605
4089: My arm, and my protection, too?
4090: 
4091: Margaret
4092: 
4093: Not lovely, nor the lady you detected,
4094: I can go home, unprotected.
4095: 
4096: (She releases herself and exits.)
4097: 
4098: Faust
4099: 
4100: By Heavens, the child is lovely!
4101: I’ve never seen anything more so.          2610
4102: She’s virtuous, yet innocently
4103: Pert, and quick-tongued though.
4104: Her rosy lips, her clear cheeks,
4105: I’ll not forget them in many a week!
4106: The way she cast down her eyes,            2615
4107: Deep in my heart, imprinted, lies:
4108: How curt in her speech she was,
4109: Well that was quite charming, of course!
4110: 
4111: (Mephistopheles enters.)
4112: 
4113: Listen, you must get that girl for me!
4114: 
4115: Mephistopheles
4116: 
4117: Which one?
4118: Faust
4119:              The girl who just went by.        2620
4120: 
4121: Mephistopheles
4122: 
4123: That one, there? She’s come from the priest,
4124: Absolved of all her sins, while I
4125: Crept into a stall nearby:
4126: She is such an innocent thing,
4127: She’s no need to sit confessing:               2625
4128: I’ve no power with such as those, I mean!
4129: 
4130: Faust
4131: 
4132: Yet, she’s older than fourteen.
4133: 
4134: Mephistopheles
4135: 
4136: Now you’re speaking like some Don Juan
4137: Who wants every flower for himself alone,
4138: Conceited enough to think there’s no honour,   2630
4139: To be plucked except by him, nor favour:
4140: But that’s never the case, you know.
4141: 
4142: Faust
4143: 
4144: Master Moraliser is that so?
4145: With me, best leave morality alone!
4146: I’m telling you, short and sweet,              2635
4147: If that young heart doesn’t beat
4148: Within my arms, tonight - so be it,
4149: At midnight, then our pact is done.
4150: 
4151: Mephistopheles
4152: 
4153: Think, what a to and fro it will take!
4154: I need at least fourteen days, to make         2640
4155: Some kind of opportunity to meet her.
4156: Faust
4157: 
4158: If I’d seven hours at my call,
4159: I’d not need the Devil at all,
4160: To seduce such a creature.
4161: 
4162: Mephistopheles
4163: 
4164: You’re almost talking like a Frenchman:       2645
4165: But don’t let yourself get all annoyed:
4166: What’s the use if she’s only part enjoyed?
4167: Your happiness won’t be as prolonged,
4168: As if you were to knead and fashion
4169: That little doll, with every passion,         2650
4170: Up and down, as yearning preaches,
4171: And many a cunning rascal teaches.
4172: 
4173: Faust
4174: 
4175: I’ve enough appetite without all that.
4176: 
4177: Mephistopheles
4178: 
4179: Now, without complaint or jesting, what
4180: I’m telling you is, with this lovely child,   2655
4181: Once and for all, you mustn’t be wild.
4182: She won’t be taken by storm, I said:
4183: We’ll need to use cunning instead.
4184: 
4185: Faust
4186: 
4187: Get me a part of the angels’ treasure!
4188: Lead me to where she lies at leisure!         2660
4189: Get me a scarf from her neck: aspire
4190: To a garter, that’s my heart’s desire.
4191: Mephistopheles
4192: 
4193: So you can see how I will strain
4194: To help you, and ease your pain,
4195: We’ll not let an instant slip away,                    2665
4196: I’ll lead you to her room today.
4197: 
4198: Faust
4199: 
4200: And shall I see her? And have her?
4201: 
4202: Mephistopheles
4203: 
4204: No! She has to visit a neighbour.
4205: Meanwhile, you can be alone there,
4206: With every hope of future pleasure,                    2670
4207: Enjoy her breathing space, at leisure.
4208: 
4209: Faust
4210: 
4211: Can we go?
4212: 
4213: Mephistopheles
4214: 
4215:          Her room’s not yet free.
4216: 
4217: Faust
4218: 
4219: Look for a gift for her, from me!
4220: 
4221:                                          (He exits.)
4222: 
4223: Mephistopheles
4224: 
4225: A present? Good! He’s sure to work it!
4226: I know many a lovely place, up here,                   2675
4227: And many an ancient buried treasure:
4228: I must have a look around for a bit.
4229:                                      (He exits.)
4230: Part I Scene VIII: Evening,
4231: A small well-kept room.
4232: 
4233: (Margaret, plaiting and fastening the braids of her hair.)
4234: 
4235: Margaret
4236: 
4237: I’d give anything if I could say
4238: Who that gentleman was, today!
4239: He’s brave for certain, I could see,                         2680
4240: And from some noble family:
4241: That his face readily told –
4242: Or he wouldn’t have been so bold.
4243: 
4244: (She exits.) (Mephistopheles and Faust appear.)
4245: 
4246: Mephistopheles
4247: 
4248: Come in: but quietly, I mean!
4249: 
4250: Faust (After a moment’s silence.)
4251: 
4252: I’d ask you, now, to leave me be!                            2685
4253: 
4254: Mephistopheles (Poking about.)
4255: 
4256: Not every girl keeps thing so clean.
4257: 
4258: (Mephistopheles exits.)
4259: 
4260: Faust
4261: 
4262: Welcome, sweet twilight glow,
4263: That weaves throughout this shrine!
4264: Sweet love-pangs grip my heart so,
4265: That on hope’s dew must live, and pine!                      2690
4266: How a breath of peace breathes around,
4267: Its order, and contentment!
4268: In this poverty, what wealth is found!
4269: In this prison, what enchantment!
4270: (He throws himself into a leather armchair near the bed.)
4271: 
4272: Accept me now, you, who with open arms                      2695
4273: Gathered joy and pain, in past days, where,
4274: How often, ah, with all their childish charms
4275: The little flock hung round their father’s chair!
4276: There my beloved, perhaps, cheeks full, stands,
4277: Grateful for all the gifts of Christmas fare,               2700
4278: Kissing her grandfather’s withered hands.
4279: Sweet girl, I feel your spirit, softly stray,
4280: Through the wealth of order, all around me,
4281: That with motherliness instructs, each day,
4282: The tablecloth to lie smooth, at your say,                  2705
4283: And even the wrinkled sand beneath your feet.
4284: O beloved hand, so goddess-like!
4285: This house because of you is Heaven’s like.
4286: And here!
4287: 
4288: (He lifts one of the bed curtains.)
4289: 
4290:         What grips me with its bliss!
4291: Here I could stand, slowly lingering.                       2710
4292: Here, Nature, in its gentlest dreaming,
4293: Formed an earthly angel within this.
4294: Here the child lay! Life, warm,
4295: Filled her delicate breast,
4296: And here, in pure and holy form,                            2715
4297: A heavenly image was expressed!
4298: And I! What leads me here?
4299: Why do I feel so deeply stirred?
4300: What do I seek? Why such a heavy heart?
4301: Poor Faust! I no longer know who you are.                   2720
4302: Is there a magic fragrance round me?
4303: I urged myself on, to the deepest delight,
4304: And feel myself melt in Love’s dreaming flight!
4305: Are we the sport of every lightest breeze?
4306: And if she appeared at this instant,                        2725
4307: How to atone for being so indiscreet?
4308: The great man, alas, of little moment!
4309: Would lie here, melting, at her feet.
4310: 
4311: Mephistopheles (Appearing.)
4312: 
4313: Quick! I see her coming, there.
4314: 
4315: Faust
4316: 
4317: Away! Away! I’ll not return again.                         2730
4318: 
4319: Mephistopheles
4320: 
4321: Here’s a casket fairly loaded, then,
4322: I’ve taken it from elsewhere.
4323: Put it just here on the chest,
4324: I swear it’ll dazzle her, when she sees:
4325: I’ve put in some trinkets, and the rest,                   2735
4326: For you to win another, if you please.
4327: Truly, a child’s a child, and play is play.
4328: 
4329: Faust
4330: 
4331: I don’t know, shall I?
4332: 
4333: Mephistopheles
4334: 
4335:                       Are you asking, pray?
4336: Perhaps you’d like to keep the treasure, too?
4337: Then I’d advise your Lustfulness,                          2740
4338: To spare the sweet hours of brightness,
4339: And spare me a heap of trouble over you.
4340: I hope that you’re not full of meanness!
4341: I scratch my head: I rub my hands –
4342: 
4343: (He places the casket in the chest, and shuts it again.)
4344: 
4345: Now off we go, and go quickly!                             2745
4346: Through this you’ll bend the child, you see,
4347: To your wish and will: as any fool understands:
4348: Yet now you seem to me
4349: As if you were heading for the lecture hall, and see
4350: Standing there grey-faced, in front of you,            2750
4351: Physics, and Metaphysics too!
4352: Now, away!
4353: 
4354: (They exit.)
4355: 
4356: (Margaret with a lamp.)
4357: 
4358: Margaret
4359: 
4360: It’s so close and sultry, here,
4361: 
4362: (She opens the window.)
4363: 
4364: And yet it’s not warm outside.
4365: It troubles me so, I don’t know why –                  2755
4366: I wish that Mother were near.
4367: A shudder ran through my whole body –
4368: I’m such a foolish girl, so timid!
4369: 
4370: (She begins to sing, while undressing.)
4371: 
4372: ‘There was a king in Thule, he
4373: Was faithful, to the grave,                            2760
4374: To whom his dying lady
4375: A golden goblet gave.
4376: 
4377: He valued nothing greater:
4378: At every feast it shone:
4379: His tears were brimming over,                          2765
4380: When he drank there-from.
4381: 
4382: When he himself was dying
4383: No towns did he with-hold,
4384: No wealth his heir denying,
4385: Except the cup of gold.                                2770
4386: He gave a royal banquet,
4387: His knights around him, all,
4388: In his sea-girt turret,
4389: In his ancestral hall.
4390: 
4391: There the old king stood, yet,                                         2775
4392: Drinking life’s last glow:
4393: Then threw the golden goblet
4394: Into the waves below.
4395: 
4396: He saw it falling, drowning,
4397: Sinking in the sea,                                                    2780
4398: Then, his eyelids closing,
4399: Never again drank he.’
4400: 
4401: (She opens the chest in order to arrange her clothes, and sees the casket.)
4402: 
4403: How can this lovely casket be here? I’m sure
4404: I locked the chest when I was here before.
4405: It’s quite miraculous! What can it hold in store?                      2785
4406: Perhaps someone brought it as security,
4407: And my mother’s granted a loan on it?
4408: There’s a ribbon hanging from it, there’s a key,
4409: I’m quite determined to open it.
4410: What’s here? Heavens! What a show,                                     2790
4411: More than I’ve ever seen in all my days!
4412: A jewel box! A noble lady might glow
4413: With all of these on high holidays!
4414: How would this chain look? This display
4415: Of splendour: who owns it, it’s so fine?                               2795
4416: 
4417: (She puts the jewellery on and stands in front of the mirror.)
4418: 
4419: If only the earrings were mine!
4420: At once one looks so different.
4421: What makes us beautiful, young blood?
4422: All that’s fine and good,
4423: But it’s discounted, in the end,                                       2800
4424: They praise us half in pity.
4425: To gold they tend,
4426: On gold depend,
4427: All things! Oh, poverty!
4428: Part I Scene IX: Promenade
4429: 
4430: (Faust walking about pensively. Mephistopheles appears.)
4431: 
4432: Mephistopheles
4433: 
4434: Scorned by all love! And by hellfire! What’s worse?        2805
4435: I wish I knew: I could use it in a curse!
4436: 
4437: Faust
4438: 
4439: What’s wrong? What’s pinching you so badly?
4440: I never, in all my life, saw such a face!
4441: 
4442: Mephistopheles
4443: 
4444: I’d pack myself off to the Devil, in disgrace,
4445: If I weren’t a Devil myself already!                       2810
4446: 
4447: Faust
4448: 
4449: Is something troubling your brain?
4450: It’s fitting that you’ve a raging pain.
4451: 
4452: Mephistopheles
4453: 
4454: To think, the priest should get his hands on
4455: Jewellery that was meant for Gretchen!
4456: Her mother snatched it up, to see,                         2815
4457: And was gripped by secret anxiety.
4458: That woman’s a marvellous sense of smell,
4459: From nosing round in her prayer-book too well,
4460: And sniffs things, ever and again,
4461: To see if they’re holy or profane:                         2820
4462: And about the jewels, she felt, that’s clear,
4463: There’s not much of a blessing here.
4464: ‘My child,’ she said, ‘ill-gotten goods
4465: Snare the soul, and dissipate the blood.
4466: We’ll dedicate it to the Virgin,                           2825
4467: She’ll repay us with manna from Heaven!’
4468: Margaret, grimacing wryly, was quite put out:
4469: Thinking: ‘Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth,
4470: He’s not a godless man, nor one to fear,
4471: He who left these fine things here.’               2830
4472: Her mother let the parson in:
4473: He’d scarcely let the game begin
4474: Before his eyes filled with enjoyment.
4475: He said: ‘So we see aright, we sinners,
4476: Who overcome themselves are winners.               2835
4477: The Church has a healthy stomach, when,
4478: It gobbles up lands, and don’t forget,
4479: It’s never over-eaten yet.
4480: The Church alone, dear lady, could
4481: Always digest ill-gotten goods.’                   2840
4482: 
4483: Faust
4484: 
4485: That’s a universal custom, too, my friend,
4486: With all those who rule, and those who lend.
4487: 
4488: Mephistopheles
4489: 
4490: Then he took the bangles, chains and rings,
4491: As if they were merely trifling things,
4492: Thanked her too, no less nor more                  2845
4493: Than if it were a sack of nuts one wore.
4494: Promised them their reward when they died,
4495: And left them suitably edified.
4496: 
4497: Faust
4498: 
4499: And Gretchen?
4500: 
4501: Mephistopheles
4502: 
4503:                 Sits there, restlessly, still
4504: Not knowing what she should do, or will,           2850
4505: Thinks of the jewels night and day,
4506: But more of him who placed them in her way.
4507: Faust
4508: 
4509: The dear girl’s sadness brings me pain.
4510: Find some jewels for her, again!
4511: Those first were not so fine, I’d say.           2855
4512: 
4513: Mephistopheles
4514: 
4515: Oh yes, to gentlemen it’s child’s play!
4516: 
4517: Faust
4518: 
4519: Fix it: arrange it, as I want you to,
4520: Attach yourself to her neighbour, too!
4521: Don’t be a devil made of clay,
4522: Get her fresh jewels straight away!              2860
4523: 
4524: 
4525: Mephistopheles
4526: 
4527: Yes, gracious sir, gladly, with all my heart.
4528: 
4529: (Faust exits.)
4530: 
4531: Such a lovesick fool would blow up the Sun,
4532: High up in the air, with the Moon and Stars,
4533: To provide his sweetheart with some diversion.
4534: 
4535: (He exits.)
4536: Part I Scene X: The Neighbour’s House
4537: 
4538: Martha (Alone.)
4539: 
4540: God forgive that man I love so well,            2865
4541: He hasn’t done right by me at all!
4542: Off into the world he’s gone,
4543: And left me here, in the dust, alone.
4544: Truly I did nothing to grieve him,
4545: I gave him, God knows, fine loving.             2870
4546: 
4547: (She weeps.)
4548: 
4549: Perhaps, he’s even dead! – Yet, oh!
4550: If I’d only his death certificate to show!
4551: 
4552: (Margaret enters.)
4553: 
4554: Margaret
4555: 
4556: Martha!
4557: 
4558: Martha
4559:      My little Gretchen, what’s happened?
4560: 
4561: Margaret
4562: 
4563: My legs are giving way beneath me!
4564: I’ve found another box of jewellery             2875
4565: In the chest: it’s of ebony, fashioned,
4566: Full of quite splendid things,
4567: And richer than the first, I think.
4568: 
4569: Martha
4570: 
4571: You’d better not tell your mother:
4572: She’ll give it to the Church, like the other.   2880
4573: Margaret
4574: 
4575: Ah, See now! See what a show!
4576: 
4577: Martha (Dressing her with jewels.)
4578: 
4579: O you’re a lucky creature, though!
4580: 
4581: Margaret
4582: 
4583: I can’t wear them in the street, alas,
4584: Nor be seen like this, at Mass.
4585: 
4586: Martha
4587: 
4588: Come often then, to me, as before:             2885
4589: You can put them on, here, secretly:
4590: Stand, for an hour, in front of the mirror,
4591: We’ll take delight in them privately.
4592: Then give us a holiday, an occasion,
4593: When people can see a fraction of them.        2890
4594: A chain first, then a pearl in the ear: your
4595: Mother won’t know, say you’d them before.
4596: 
4597: Margaret
4598: 
4599: Who could have left the second casket?
4600: There’s something not proper about it!
4601: 
4602: (A knock.)
4603: 
4604: Good God! Is it my mother, then?               2895
4605: 
4606: Martha (Looking through the shutter.)
4607: 
4608: It’s a stranger, a gentleman – Come in!
4609: (Mephistopheles enters.)
4610: 
4611: Mephistopheles
4612: 
4613: In introducing myself so freely,
4614: I ask you ladies to excuse me.
4615: 
4616: (He steps back reverently on seeing Margaret.)
4617: 
4618: It’s Martha Schwerdtlein I seek!
4619: 
4620: Martha
4621: 
4622: I’m she, what do you wish with me?               2900
4623: 
4624: Mephistopheles (Aside to her.)
4625: 
4626: I know you now: that’s enough for me:
4627: You’ve a distinguished visitor there, I see.
4628: Pardon the liberty I’ve taken, pray,
4629: I’ll return this afternoon, if I may.
4630: 
4631: Martha (Aloud.)
4632: 
4633: To think, child: of all things: just fancy!      2905
4634: The gentleman takes you for a lady.
4635: 
4636: Margaret
4637: 
4638: I’m a poor young thing he’ll find:
4639: Heavens! The gentleman’s far too kind:
4640: The jewels and trinkets aren’t mine.
4641: 
4642: Mephistopheles
4643: 
4644: Ah, it’s not just the jewellery, mind:           2910
4645: The look: the manner: she has a way!
4646: I’m pleased that I’m allowed to stay.
4647: Martha
4648: 
4649: What brings you here? I wish that you –
4650: 
4651: Mephistopheles
4652: 
4653: I wish I brought you happier news! –
4654: This news I hope you’ll forgive me repeating:   2915
4655: Your husband’s dead, but sends a greeting.
4656: 
4657: Martha
4658: 
4659: He’s dead? That true heart! Oh!
4660: My man is dead! I’ll die, also!
4661: 
4662: Margaret
4663: 
4664: Ah! Dear lady, don’t despair!
4665: 
4666: Mephistopheles
4667: 
4668: Hear the mournful tale I bear!                  2920
4669: 
4670: Margaret
4671: 
4672: That’s why I’ll never love while I’ve breath,
4673: Such a loss would grieve me to death.
4674: 
4675: Mephistopheles
4676: 
4677: Joy must have sorrows: sorrow its joys, too.
4678: 
4679: Martha
4680: 
4681: Tell me of his last hours: ah tell me!
4682: Mephistopheles
4683: 
4684: He’s buried in Padua, close to              2925
4685: The blessed Saint Anthony,
4686: In a consecrated space,
4687: A cool eternal resting place.
4688: 
4689: Martha
4690: 
4691: Have you brought nothing else, from him?
4692: 
4693: Mephistopheles
4694: 
4695: Yes a request, it’s large and heavy:        2930
4696: For you to sing a hundred masses for him!
4697: Otherwise, no, my pocket’s empty.
4698: 
4699: Martha
4700: 
4701: What? No piece of show? No jewellery?
4702: What every workman has in his purse,
4703: And keeps with him as his reserve,          2935
4704: Rather than having to starve or beg!
4705: 
4706: Mephistopheles
4707: 
4708: Madam, it’s a heavy grief to me:
4709: But truly his money wasn’t wasted.
4710: And then, he felt his errors greatly,
4711: Yes, and bemoaned his bad luck lately.      2940
4712: 
4713: Margaret
4714: 
4715: Ah! How unlucky all men are! I’ll
4716: Be sure to offer many a prayer for him.
4717: 
4718: Mephistopheles
4719: 
4720: You’re worthy of soon marrying:
4721: You’re such a kindly child.
4722: Margaret
4723: 
4724: Oh, no! That wouldn’t do as yet.                      2945
4725: 
4726: Mephistopheles
4727: 
4728: If not a husband, a lover, while you wait.
4729: It’s heaven’s greatest charm,
4730: To have a dear one on one’s arm.
4731: 
4732: Margaret
4733: 
4734: That’s not the custom of the country.
4735: 
4736: Mephistopheles
4737: 
4738: Custom or not! It seems to be.                        2950
4739: 
4740: Martha
4741: 
4742: Go on with your tale!
4743: 
4744: Mephistopheles
4745: 
4746:               I stood beside his death-bed,
4747: Hardly better than a rubbish-tip, poor man,
4748: Of half-rotten straw: yet he died a Christian,
4749: And found that he was even further in debt.
4750: ‘Alas,’ he cried, ‘I hate myself, with good reason,   2955
4751: For leaving, as I did, my wife and my occupation!
4752: Ah the memory of that is killing me,
4753: Would in this life I might be forgiven, though!’
4754: 
4755: Martha (Weeping.)
4756: 
4757: The dear man! I forgave him long ago.
4758: Mephistopheles
4759: 
4760: ‘Although, God knows, she was more to blame than me.’   2960
4761: 
4762: Martha
4763: 
4764: The liar! What! At death’s door, lies he was telling!
4765: 
4766: Mephistopheles
4767: 
4768: In his last wanderings, he was rambling,
4769: If I’m any judge myself of the thing.
4770: ‘I had,’ he said, ‘no time to gaze in play:
4771: First children, then bread for them each day,           2965
4772: And I mean bread in the wider sense:
4773: And couldn’t even eat my share in silence.’
4774: 
4775: Martha
4776: 
4777: Did he forget the love, the loyalty,
4778: My drudgery, night and day!
4779: 
4780: Mephistopheles
4781: 
4782: Not at all, he thought of it deeply, in his way.        2970
4783: He said: ‘As I was leaving Malta
4784: I prayed hard for my wife and children:
4785: And favour came to me from heaven,
4786: Since our ship took a Turkish cutter,
4787: Carrying the great Sultan’s treasure.                   2975
4788: There was a reward for bravery,
4789: And I received, in due measure,
4790: The generous share that fell to me.’
4791: 
4792: Martha
4793: 
4794: What? And where? Has he buried it by chance?
4795: Mephistopheles
4796: 
4797: Who can tell: the four winds know the circumstance.   2980
4798: A lovely girl there took him on,
4799: As he, a stranger, roamed round Naples:
4800: She gave him loyalty, and loved the man,
4801: And he felt it so, till his last hour fell.
4802: 
4803: Martha
4804: 
4805: He stole from his children, and his wife!             2985
4806: The rogue! All the pain and misery he met,
4807: Couldn’t keep him from that shameful life!
4808: 
4809: Mephistopheles
4810: 
4811: Ah, but: now he’s died of it!
4812: If I were truly in your place,
4813: I’d mourn him quietly for a year,                     2990
4814: And look, meanwhile, for a dear new face.
4815: 
4816: Martha
4817: 
4818: Ah, sweet God! I’ll not easily find another,
4819: In all the world, such as my first one was!
4820: There never was a dearer fool than mine.
4821: Only he loved roaming too much, at last,              2995
4822: And foreign women, and foreign wine,
4823: And the rolling of those cursed dice.
4824: 
4825: Mephistopheles
4826: 
4827: Well, that would have still been fine,
4828: If, with you, he’d followed that line,
4829: And noticed nothing, on your side.                    3000
4830: I swear that, with that same condition,
4831: I’d swap rings with you, no question!
4832: Martha
4833: 
4834: O, the gentleman’s pleased to jest!
4835: 
4836: Mephistopheles (To himself.)
4837: 
4838: I must fly from here, swift as a bird!
4839: She might hold the Devil to his word.                3005
4840: 
4841: (To Gretchen.)
4842: 
4843: How does your heart feel? At rest?
4844: 
4845: Margaret
4846: 
4847: What does the gentleman mean?
4848: 
4849: Mephistopheles (To himself.)
4850: 
4851:                           Sweet, innocent child!
4852: 
4853: (Aloud.)
4854: 
4855: Farewell, ladies!
4856: 
4857: Margaret
4858:              Farewell!
4859: 
4860: Martha
4861:                      Oh, speak to me yet, a while!
4862: I’d like a witness, as to where, how, and when
4863: My darling man died and was buried: then,            3010
4864: As I’ve always been a friend of tradition,
4865: Put his death in the paper, the weekly edition.
4866: Mephistopheles
4867: 
4868: Yes, dear lady, two witnesses you need
4869: To verify the truth, or so all agree:
4870: I’ve a rather fine companion,            3015
4871: He can be your second man.
4872: I’ll bring him here.
4873: 
4874: Martha
4875:                    Oh yes, please do!
4876: 
4877: Mephistopheles
4878: 
4879: That young lady will be here, too?
4880: He’s a brave youth! Travelled, yes,
4881: And with ladies he’s all politeness.     3020
4882: 
4883: Margaret
4884: 
4885: I’d be shamed before the gentleman.
4886: 
4887: Mephistopheles
4888: 
4889: Not before any king on earth, madam.
4890: 
4891: Martha
4892: 
4893: Behind the house, then, in my garden,
4894: Tonight: we’ll expect you gentlemen.
4895: Part I Scene XI: The Street
4896: 
4897: (Faust. Mephistopheles.)
4898: 
4899: Faust
4900: 
4901: How goes it? Will it be? Will it soon be done?         3025
4902: 
4903: Mephistopheles
4904: 
4905: Ah, bravo! Do I find you all on fire?
4906: In double-quick time you’ll have your desire.
4907: You’ll meet tonight, at her neighbour Martha’s home:
4908: There’s a woman, who’s the thing,
4909: For procuring and for gipsying!                        3030
4910: 
4911: Faust
4912: 
4913: All right!
4914: 
4915: Mephistopheles
4916:     But, she needs something from us, too.
4917: 
4918: Faust
4919: 
4920: One good turn deserves another, true.
4921: 
4922: Mephistopheles
4923: 
4924: We only have to bear a valid witness,
4925: That her husband’s outstretched members bless
4926: A consecrated place in Padua.                          3035
4927: 
4928: Faust
4929: 
4930: Brilliant! We must first make the journey there!
4931: Mephistopheles
4932: 
4933: Sacred Simplicity! There’s no need to do that.
4934: Just testify, without saying too much to her.
4935: 
4936: Faust
4937: 
4938: If you can’t do better than that, your pact I’ll tear.
4939: 
4940: Mephistopheles
4941: 
4942: O holy man! Now I see you there!                         3040
4943: Is it the first time in your life, come swear,
4944: That you’ve ever born false witness?
4945: Haven’t you shown skill in definition
4946: Of God, the World, what’s in it, Men,
4947: What moves them, in mind and breast?                     3045
4948: With impudent brow, and swollen chest?
4949: And if you look at it more deeply, oh yes,
4950: Did you know as much now - confess,
4951: As you do about Herr Schwerdtlein’s death?
4952: 
4953: Faust
4954: 
4955: You are, and you’ll remain, a Liar and a Sophist.        3050
4956: 
4957: Mephistopheles
4958: 
4959: Yes when no one’s the wiser for it.
4960: This coming morn, in all honour though,
4961: Won’t you beguile poor Gretchen so:
4962: And swear you love her with all your soul?
4963: 
4964: Faust
4965: 
4966: From my heart.
4967: Mephistopheles
4968: 
4969:                    Well, and good!                3055
4970: And will your eternal Truth and Love,
4971: Your one all-powerful Force, above –
4972: Flow from your heart, too, as it should?
4973: 
4974: Faust
4975: 
4976: Stop! Stop! It will! If I but feel,
4977: For that emotion, for that throng,                3060
4978: Seek the name, that none reveal,
4979: Roam, with senses, through the world.
4980: Seize on every highest word,
4981: And call the fire, that I’m tasting,
4982: Endless, eternal, everlasting –                   3065
4983: Does that to some devil’s game of lies belong?
4984: 
4985: Mephistopheles
4986: 
4987: Yet, I’m still right!
4988: 
4989: Faust
4990: 
4991:                      Hear one thing more,
4992: I beg you, and spare my breath – the one
4993: Who wants to hold fast, and has a tongue,
4994: He’ll hold for sure.                              3070
4995: Come, chattering fills me with disgust,
4996: And then you’re right, especially since I must.
4997: Part I Scene XII: The Garden
4998: 
4999: (Margaret on Faust’s arm, Martha and Mephistopheles walking up and
5000: down.)
5001: 
5002: I know the gentleman flatters me,
5003: Lowers himself, and shames me, too.
5004: A traveller is used to being                               3075
5005: Content, out of courtesy, with any food.
5006: I know too well, so learned a man,
5007: Can’t feed himself on my poor bran.
5008: 
5009: Faust
5010: 
5011: A glance, a word from you, feeds me more,
5012: Than all the world’s wisest lore.                          3080
5013: 
5014: (He kisses her hand.)
5015: 
5016: Margaret
5017: 
5018: Don’t trouble yourself! How could you kiss it?
5019: It’s such a nasty, rough thing!
5020: What work haven’t I done with it!
5021: My mother’s so exacting.
5022: 
5023: (They move on.)
5024: 
5025: Martha
5026: 
5027: And you, sir, you’re always travelling?                           3085
5028: 
5029: Mephistopheles
5030: 
5031: Ah, work and duty are such a bother!
5032: There’s many a place one’s sad at leaving,
5033: And daren’t stay a moment longer!
5034: Martha
5035: 
5036: In youth it’s fine, up and down,
5037: Flitting about, the whole world over:            3090
5038: Then harsher days come round,
5039: And lonely bachelors small joy discover,
5040: In sliding towards their hole in the ground.
5041: 
5042: Mephistopheles
5043: 
5044: I view the prospect with horror.
5045: 
5046: Martha
5047: 
5048: Then take advice in time, dear sir.              3095
5049: 
5050: (They move on.)
5051: 
5052: Margaret
5053: 
5054: Yes, out of sight is out of mind!
5055: Politeness comes naturally to you:
5056: But you’ll meet friends, often, who,
5057: Are more sensible than me, you’ll find.
5058: 
5059: Faust
5060: 
5061: Dearest, believe me, what men call sense,        3100
5062: Is often just vanity and short-sightedness.
5063: 
5064: Margaret
5065:                                        How so?
5066: 
5067: Faust
5068: 
5069: Ah, that simplicity and innocence never know
5070: Themselves, or their heavenly worth!
5071: That humble meekness, the highest grace
5072: That Nature bestows so lovingly –                3105
5073: Margaret
5074: 
5075: It’s only for a moment that you think of me,
5076: I’ve plenty of time to dream about your face.
5077: 
5078: Faust
5079: 
5080: You’re often alone, then?
5081: 
5082: Margaret
5083: 
5084: Yes, our household’s a little one,
5085: Yet it has to be cared for by someone.          3110
5086: We have no servant: I sweep, knit, sew,
5087: And cook, I’m working early and late:
5088: And in everything my mother is so
5089: Strict, and straight.
5090: Not that she has to be quite so economical:     3115
5091: We could be more generous than others:
5092: My father left a little fortune for us:
5093: A house and garden by the town-wall.
5094: But now my days are spent quietly:
5095: My brother is a soldier: I’d                    3120
5096: A younger sister who died.
5097: The trouble I had with that child:
5098: Yet I’d take it on again, the worry,
5099: She was so dear to me.
5100: 
5101: Faust
5102:                    An angel, if like you.
5103: 
5104: Margaret
5105: 
5106: I raised her, and she loved me too.             3125
5107: After my father died, she was born,
5108: We gave mother up for lost, so worn
5109: And wretchedly she lay there then,
5110: And slowly, day by day, grew well again.
5111: She couldn’t think of feeding                   3130
5112: It herself: that poor little thing,
5113: And so I nursed it all alone,
5114: On milk and water, as if it were my own,
5115: In my arms, in my lap,
5116: It charmed me, tumbling, and grew fat.               3135
5117: 
5118: Faust
5119: 
5120: You found your greatest happiness there, for sure.
5121: 
5122: Margaret
5123: 
5124: But also truly many a weary hour.
5125: The baby’s cradle stood at night
5126: Beside my bed: and if it hardly stirred
5127: I woke outright:                                     3140
5128: Now I nursed it, now laid it beside me: heard
5129: When it cried, and left my bed, and often
5130: Danced it back and forth, in the room: and then,
5131: At break of dawn stood at the washtub, again:
5132: Then the market and the kitchen, oh,                 3145
5133: And every day just like tomorrow.
5134: One sometimes lacks the courage, sir, and yet
5135: One appreciates one’s food and rest.
5136: 
5137: (They move on.)
5138: 
5139: Martha
5140: 
5141: Women have the worst of it: it’s true:
5142: A bachelor is hard to change, you see.               3150
5143: 
5144: Mephistopheles
5145: 
5146: That just depends on the likes of you,
5147: The right teacher might improve me.
5148: 
5149: Martha
5150: 
5151: Say, have you never found anyone, dear sir?
5152: Has your heart never been captured, anywhere?
5153: Mephistopheles
5154: 
5155: The proverb says: A hearth of your own,             3155
5156: And a good wife, are worth pearls and gold.
5157: 
5158: Martha
5159: 
5160: I mean: have you never felt desire, even lightly?
5161: 
5162: Mephistopheles
5163: 
5164: I’ve everywhere been treated most politely.
5165: 
5166: Martha
5167: 
5168: I meant to say: were you never seriously smitten?
5169: 
5170: Mephistopheles
5171: 
5172: With ladies, one should never dare be flippant.     3160
5173: 
5174: Martha
5175: 
5176: Ah, you won’t understand me!
5177: 
5178: Mephistopheles
5179:           I am sorry! Yet you’ll find
5180: I understand – that you are very kind.
5181: 
5182: (They move on.)
5183: 
5184: Faust
5185: 
5186: And, Angel, did you recognise me again,
5187: As soon as I appeared in the garden?
5188: 
5189: Margaret
5190: 
5191: Didn’t you see my gaze drop then?                   3165
5192: Faust
5193: 
5194: And you forgive the liberty I’ve taken,
5195: The impertinence of it all,
5196: Just as you were leaving the Cathedral?
5197: 
5198: Margaret
5199: 
5200: I was flustered, such a thing’s never happened to me:
5201: ‘Ah’, I thought, ‘has he seen, in your behaviour,               3170
5202: Something that’s impertinent or improper?
5203: No one could ever say anything bad about me.
5204: He seems to be walking suddenly, with you,
5205: As though he dealt with a girl of easy virtue’.
5206: I confess, I didn’t know what it was, though,                   3175
5207: That I began to feel, and to your advantage too,
5208: But certainly I was angry with myself, oh,
5209: That I could not be angrier with you.
5210: 
5211: Faust
5212: 
5213: Sweet darling!
5214: 
5215: Margaret
5216: 
5217: Wait a moment!
5218: 
5219: (She picks a Marguerite and pulls the petals off one by one.)
5220: 
5221: Faust
5222:                    What’s that for, a bouquet?
5223: 
5224: Margaret
5225: 
5226: No, it’s a game.
5227: 
5228: Faust
5229:                    What?
5230: Margaret
5231:                       No, you’ll laugh if I say!    3180
5232: 
5233: (She pulls off the petals, murmuring to herself.)
5234: 
5235: Faust
5236: 
5237: What are you whispering?
5238: 
5239: Margaret (Half aloud.)
5240: 
5241:          He loves me – he loves me not.
5242: 
5243: Faust
5244: 
5245: You sweet face that Heaven forgot!
5246: 
5247: Margaret (Continuing.)
5248: 
5249: Loves me – Not – Loves me – Not
5250: 
5251: (She plucks the last petal with delight.)
5252: 
5253: He loves me!
5254: 
5255: Faust
5256: 
5257:             Yes, my child! Let this flower-speech
5258: Be heaven’s speech to you. He loves you!            3185
5259: Do you know what that means? He loves you!
5260: 
5261: (He grasps her hands.)
5262: 
5263: Margaret
5264: 
5265: I’m trembling!
5266: 
5267: Faust
5268:                     Don’t tremble, let this look,
5269: Let this clasping of hands tell you
5270: What’s inexpressible:                                                   3190
5271: To give oneself wholly, and feel
5272: A joy that must be eternal!
5273: Eternal! – Its end would bring despair.
5274: No, no end! No end!
5275: 
5276: (Margaret presses his hand, frees herself, and runs away. He stands a
5277: moment in thought: then follows her.)
5278: 
5279: Martha (Coming forward.)
5280: 
5281: Night is falling.
5282: 
5283: Mephistopheles
5284: 
5285:              Yes, and we must away.                            3195
5286: 
5287: Martha
5288: 
5289: I’d ask you to remain here longer,
5290: But this is quite a wicked place.
5291: It’s as if they had nothing to do yonder,
5292: And no work they should be doing
5293: But watching their neighbours’ to-ing and fro-ing,                      3200
5294: And whatever one does, insults are hurled.
5295: And our couple, now?
5296: 
5297: Mephistopheles
5298: 
5299:                Flown up the passage, there.
5300: Wilful little birds!
5301: 
5302: Martha
5303: 
5304:                     He seems keen on her.
5305: 
5306: Mephistopheles
5307: 
5308: And she on him. It’s the way of the world.
5309: Part I Scene XIII: An Arbour in the Garden
5310: 
5311: (Margaret comes in, hides behind the door of the garden-house, holds her
5312: fingers to her lips, and peeps through the gaps.)
5313: 
5314: Margaret
5315: 
5316: He’s coming.
5317: 
5318: Faust (Appearing.)
5319: 
5320:               Ah, rascal, you tease me so! I’ve got you!            3205
5321: 
5322: (He kisses her.)
5323: 
5324: Margaret (Clasping him, and returning the kiss.)
5325: 
5326: Dearest man! With all my heart I love you!
5327: 
5328: (Mephistopheles knocks.)
5329: 
5330: Faust (Stamping his foot in frustration.)
5331: 
5332: Who’s there?
5333: 
5334: Mephistopheles
5335: 
5336:         A dear friend!
5337: 
5338: Faust
5339:               A creature!
5340: 
5341: 
5342: Mephistopheles
5343:                                  It’s time to go.
5344: Martha (Appearing.)
5345: 
5346: Yes, sir, it’s late!
5347: 
5348: Faust
5349: 
5350:         May I keep company with you, though?
5351: 
5352: Margaret
5353: 
5354: My mother would tell me, – Farewell!
5355: 
5356: Faust
5357:                                         Must I go, then?
5358: Farewell!
5359: 
5360: Martha
5361: 
5362:                Goodbye, now!
5363: 
5364: Margaret
5365: 
5366:                                And soon to meet again!     3210
5367: 
5368: (Faust and Mephistopheles exit.)
5369: 
5370: Margaret
5371: 
5372: Dear God! That one man, by thinking,
5373: Can know everything, oh, everything!
5374: I stand in front of him, ashamed
5375: And just say yes to all he says.
5376: I’m such a poor, ignorant child, and he -                  3215
5377: I can’t understand what he sees in me.
5378: Part I Scene XIV: Forest and Cavern
5379: 
5380: 
5381: (Faust, alone.)
5382: 
5383: Sublime spirit, you gave me all, all,
5384: I asked for. Not in vain have you
5385: Revealed your face to me in flame.
5386: You gave me Nature’s realm of splendour,      3220
5387: With the power to feel it, and enjoy.
5388: Not merely as a cold, awed stranger,
5389: But allowing me to look deep inside,
5390: Like seeing into the heart of a friend.
5391: You lead the ranks of living creatures        3225
5392: Before me, showing me my brothers
5393: In the silent woods, the air, the water.
5394: And when the storm roars in the forest,
5395: When giant firs fell their neighbours,
5396: Crushing nearby branches in their fall,       3230
5397: Filling the hills with hollow thunder,
5398: You lead me to the safety of a cave,
5399: Show me my own self, and reveal
5400: Your deep, secret wonders in my heart.
5401: And when the pure Moon, to my eyes,           3235
5402: Rises, calming me, the silvery visions
5403: Of former times, drift all around me,
5404: From high cliffs, and moist thickets,
5405: Tempering thought’s austere delight.
5406: Oh, I know now that nothing can be            3240
5407: Perfect for Mankind. You gave me,
5408: With this joy, that brings me nearer,
5409: Nearer to the gods, a companion,
5410: Whom I can no longer do without,
5411: Though he is impudent, and chilling,
5412: Degrades me in my own eyes, and with          3245
5413: A word, a breath, makes your gifts nothing.
5414: He fans a wild fire in my heart,
5415: Always alive to that lovely form.
5416: So I rush from desire to enjoyment,
5417: And in enjoyment pine to feel desire.         3250
5418: (Mephistopheles enters.)
5419: 
5420: Mephistopheles
5421: 
5422: Haven’t you had enough of this life yet?
5423: How can you be happy all this time?
5424: It’s fine for a man to try it for a bit,
5425: But then you need a newer clime!
5426: 
5427: Faust
5428: 
5429: I wish you’d something else to do,            3255
5430: Than plague me on a good day.
5431: 
5432: Mephistopheles
5433: 
5434: Now, now! I’d gladly ignore you,
5435: You don’t really mean it anyway.
5436: You’d be little loss to me,
5437: A rude, mad, sour companion.                  3260
5438: One’s hands are full all day, and see,
5439: What pleases you, or what to let be,
5440: No one can tell from your expression.
5441: 
5442: Faust
5443: 
5444: So that’s the tone he takes!
5445: I’m to thank him, for boring me.              3265
5446: 
5447: Mephistopheles
5448: 
5449: Poor Son of Earth, how could you make
5450: Your way through life without me?
5451: I’ve cured you for a while at least
5452: Of your twitches of imagination,
5453: If I weren’t here, you’d certainly            3270
5454: Have walked right off this earthly station.
5455: In rocky hollows, in a hole,
5456: Why sit around here, like an owl?
5457: From soaking moss and dripping stone,
5458: Sucking your nourishment, like a toad?                3275
5459: Spend your time sweeter, better!
5460: Your body’s still stuck there with the Doctor.
5461: 
5462: Faust
5463: 
5464: Do you understand the new power of being
5465: That a walk in the wilderness can bring?
5466: But then, if you were able to guess,                  3280
5467: You’re devil enough to begrudge my happiness.
5468: 
5469: Mephistopheles
5470: 
5471: An other-worldly pleasure.
5472: Night and day, mountains for leisure.
5473: Clasping heaven and earth, blissfully,
5474: Inflating yourself, becoming a deity.                 3285
5475: With expectant urge burrowing through earth’s core,
5476: Feeling all that six days’ work, in yours,
5477: To taste who knows what, in power’s pride,
5478: Overflowing, almost, with the joy of life,
5479: Vanishing, the Earthly Son,                           3290
5480: And into some deep Intuition –
5481: 
5482: (With a gesture.)
5483: 
5484: I can’t say how – passing inside.
5485: 
5486: Faust
5487: 
5488: Fie, on you!
5489: 
5490: Mephistopheles
5491: 
5492:              Ah, you don’t like it from me!
5493: You’ve the right, to say ‘fie’ to me, politely.
5494: Before chaste ears men daren’t speak aloud,           3295
5495: That which chaste hearts can’t do without:
5496: Short and sweet, I begrudge the pleasure you get
5497: From occasionally lying to yourself, about it.
5498: But you won’t hold out for long, I’m sure.
5499: You’re already over-driven,                      3300
5500: Sooner or later you’ll be given
5501: To madness, or to fear and horror.
5502: Enough! Your lover sits inside,
5503: All is dull, oppressive to her,
5504: She can’t get you out of her mind,               3305
5505: Her deep love overwhelms her.
5506: First your love’s flood round her flowed,
5507: As a stream pours from melted snow:
5508: You’ve so filled her heart, and now,
5509: Your stream again is shallow.                    3310
5510: Instead of enthroning yourself in the wood,
5511: Let the great gentleman do some good,
5512: To that poor little ape of flesh and blood,
5513: And reward her, I think, for her love.
5514: Her days seem pitifully long:                    3315
5515: She sits at the window, cloud drifting
5516: Over the old City wall, sees it lifting.
5517: ‘Would I were a little bird!’ runs her song,
5518: All day long, and all night long.
5519: Sometimes lively, mostly not,                    3320
5520: Sometimes crying out, in tears,
5521: Then quiet again, it appears,
5522: And always in love.
5523: 
5524: Faust
5525: 
5526: You snake! You snake, you!
5527: 
5528: Mephistopheles
5529: 
5530: A touch! That caught you!                        3325
5531: Faust
5532: 
5533: Wretch! Be gone from my presence:
5534: Don’t name that lovely girl to me!
5535: Don’t bring desire for that sweet body
5536: Before every half-maddened sense!
5537: 
5538: Mephistopheles
5539: 
5540: Well, what then? She thinks you’ve flown away,     3330
5541: And, half and half, you already have, I’d say.
5542: 
5543: Faust
5544: 
5545: I’m near her, and were I still far,
5546: I can’t lose her or forget her,
5547: I even envy the body of our Lord,
5548: When her lips touch it at the altar.               3335
5549: 
5550: Mephistopheles
5551: 
5552: Quite so, my friend! My envy often closes
5553: On that pair of twins that feed among the roses.
5554: 
5555: Faust
5556: 
5557: Away from me, procurer!
5558: 
5559: Mephistopheles
5560: 
5561:          Fine, you curse and I must smile.
5562: The god who made both man and woman,
5563: He likewise knew the noblest profession,           3340
5564: So made the opportunity as well.
5565: Go on, it’s a crying shame!
5566: Since you’re bound, all the same
5567: For your lover’s room, not death.
5568: Faust
5569: 
5570: Where is the heavenly joy in her arms?             3345
5571: Let me warm myself with her charms!
5572: Do I not always feel her absent breath?
5573: Am I not the fugitive? The homeless one?
5574: The creature without aim or rest,
5575: A torrent in the rocks, still thundering down,     3350
5576: Foaming eagerly into the abyss?
5577: And she beside it, with vague childlike mind,
5578: In a hut there, on a little Alpine field,
5579: So, her first homely life you’d find,
5580: Hidden there in that little world.                 3355
5581: And I, the god-forsaken,
5582: Was not great enough,
5583: To grasp the cliffs, and take them,
5584: And crush them into dust!
5585: I still must undermine her peaceful life!          3360
5586: You, Hell, must have your sacrifice.
5587: Help, Devil, curtail the anxious moment brewing.
5588: What must be, let it be, and swiftly!
5589: Let her fate also fall on me,
5590: And she and I rush to ruin!                        3365
5591: 
5592: Mephistopheles
5593: 
5594: Again it glows: again it seethes!
5595: Go in and comfort her, you fool!
5596: When a brain, like yours, no exit sees,
5597: It calls it the end of all things, too.
5598: Praise him who keeps his courage fresh!            3370
5599: Or you’ll soon get quite be-devilled, there.
5600: I find nothing in the world so tasteless,
5601: As a Devil, in despair.
5602: Part I Scene XV: Gretchen’s Room
5603: 
5604: (Gretchen alone at the spinning wheel.)
5605: 
5606: ‘My peace is gone,
5607: My heart is sore:                         3375
5608: I’ll find it, never,
5609: Oh, nevermore.
5610: 
5611: When he’s not here,
5612: My grave is near,
5613: The world is all,                         3380
5614: A bitter gall.
5615: 
5616: My poor head
5617: Feels crazed to me.
5618: My poor brain
5619: Seems dazed to me.                        3385
5620: 
5621: My peace is gone,
5622: My heart is sore:
5623: I’ll find it, never,
5624: Oh, nevermore.
5625: 
5626: Only to see him                           3390
5627: I look out.
5628: Only to meet him,
5629: I leave the house.
5630: 
5631: His proud steps,
5632: His noble figure,                         3395
5633: His smiling lips,
5634: His eyes: their power.
5635: 
5636: And all his speech
5637: Like magic is,
5638: His fingers’ touch,                       3400
5639: And, oh, his kiss!
5640: My peace is gone,
5641: My heart is sore:
5642: I’ll find it, never,
5643: Oh, nevermore.         3405
5644: 
5645: My heart aches
5646: To be with him,
5647: Oh if I could
5648: Cling to him,
5649: 
5650: And kiss him,          3410
5651: The way I wish,
5652: So I might die,
5653: At his kiss!
5654: Part I Scene XVI: Martha’s Garden
5655: 
5656: (Margaret. Faust.)
5657: 
5658: Margaret
5659: 
5660: Promise me, Heinrich!
5661: 
5662: Faust
5663:                               If I can!
5664: 
5665: Margaret
5666: 
5667: Say, as regards religion, how you feel.              3415
5668: I know that you are a dear, good man,
5669: Yet, for you, it seems, it has no appeal.
5670: 
5671: Faust
5672: 
5673: Leave that alone, child! You feel I’m kind to you:
5674: For Love I’d give my blood, my life too.
5675: I’ll rob no man of his church and faith.             3420
5676: 
5677: Margaret
5678: 
5679: That’s not right, we must have faith.
5680: 
5681: Faust
5682: 
5683: Must we?
5684: 
5685: Margaret
5686: 
5687:       Ah, if in this I was only fluent!
5688: You don’t respect the Holy Sacrament.
5689: 
5690: Faust
5691: 
5692: I respect it.
5693: Margaret
5694: 
5695:   Without wanting it, though. You’ve passed
5696: So many years without confession, or mass.    3425
5697: Do you believe in God?
5698: 
5699: Faust
5700: 
5701:               My darling, who dare say:
5702: ‘I believe in God’?
5703: Choose priest to ask, or sage,
5704: The answer would seem a joke, would it not,
5705: Played on whoever asks?
5706: 
5707: Margaret
5708: 
5709:                   So, you don’t believe?      3430
5710: 
5711: Faust
5712: 
5713: Sweetest being, don’t misunderstand me!
5714: Who dares name the nameless?
5715: Or who dares to confess:
5716: ‘I believe in him’?
5717: Yet who, in feeling,                          3435
5718: Self-revealing,
5719: Says: ‘I don’t believe’?
5720: The all-clasping,
5721: The all-upholding,
5722: Does it not clasp, uphold,                    3440
5723: You: me, itself?
5724: Don’t the heavens arch above us?
5725: Doesn’t earth lie here under our feet?
5726: And don’t the eternal stars, rising,
5727: Look down on us in friendship?                3445
5728: Are not my eyes reflected in yours?
5729: And don’t all things press
5730: On your head and heart,
5731: And weave, in eternal mystery,
5732: Visibly: invisibly, around you?                    3450
5733: Fill your heart from it: it is so vast,
5734: And when you are blessed by the deepest feeling,
5735: Call it then what you wish,
5736: Joy! Heart! Love! God!
5737: I have no name                                     3455
5738: For it! Feeling is all:
5739: Names are sound and smoke,
5740: Veiling Heaven’s bright glow.
5741: 
5742: Margaret
5743: 
5744: That’s all well and good, I know,
5745: The priest says much the same,                     3460
5746: Only, in slightly different words.
5747: 
5748: Faust
5749: 
5750: It’s what all hearts, say, everywhere
5751: Under the heavenly day,
5752: Each in its own speech:
5753: And why not I in mine?                             3465
5754: 
5755: Margaret
5756: 
5757: Listening to you, it almost seems quite fine,
5758: Yet something still seems wrong, to me,
5759: Since you don’t possess Christianity.
5760: 
5761: Faust
5762: 
5763: Dear child!
5764: 
5765: Margaret
5766: 
5767:       I’ve long been grieved
5768: To see you in such company.                        3470
5769: Faust
5770: 
5771: Why, who?
5772: 
5773: Margaret
5774: 
5775: That man who hangs round you so,
5776: I hate him in my innermost soul:
5777: Nothing in all my life has ever
5778: Given my heart such pain, no, never,
5779: As his repulsive face has done.            3475
5780: 
5781: Faust
5782: 
5783: Don’t be afraid of him, sweet one!
5784: 
5785: Margaret
5786: 
5787: His presence here, it chills my blood.
5788: To every other man I wish good:
5789: But much as I’m longing to see you
5790: I’ve a secret horror of seeing him, too,   3480
5791: I’ve thought him a rogue, all along!
5792: God forgive me, if I do him wrong!
5793: 
5794: Faust
5795: 
5796: There have to be such odd fellows.
5797: 
5798: Margaret
5799: 
5800: I’d rather not live with such as those!
5801: Once he’s inside the door, again,          3485
5802: He looks around in a mocking way,
5803: And half-severely:
5804: You can see he’s not at all in sympathy:
5805: It’s written on his forehead even,
5806: That there’s no spirit of love within.     3490
5807: I’m so happy in your arms,
5808: Free, untroubled, and so warm,
5809: Yet I’m stifled in his presence.
5810: 
5811: Faust
5812: 
5813: You angel, full of presentiments!
5814: 
5815: Margaret
5816: 
5817: It oppresses me, so deeply, too,                3495
5818: That when he meets with us, wherever,
5819: I feel that I no longer love you.
5820: Ah I can’t pray when he’s there,
5821: And that gnaws inside me: oh,
5822: Heinrich, for you too, surely it’s so.          3500
5823: 
5824: Faust
5825: 
5826: It’s merely an antipathy!
5827: 
5828: Margaret
5829: 
5830: I must go now.
5831: 
5832: Faust
5833: 
5834:                     Ah, will there never be
5835: An hour where I can clasp you to my heart,
5836: And heart to heart, and soul, to soul impart?
5837: 
5838: Margaret
5839: 
5840: Ah, if I only slept alone!                      3505
5841: For you, I’d gladly draw the bolt tonight:
5842: But my mother hears the slightest tone,
5843: And if we were caught outright,
5844: I’d die on the selfsame spot!
5845: Faust
5846: 
5847: You angel: no need for that.                       3510
5848: Here is a little phial to keep!
5849: Three drops of this, in her drink, she’ll take,
5850: And Nature will favour her with deepest sleep.
5851: 
5852: Margaret
5853: 
5854: What would I not do for your sake?
5855: I hope that it won’t harm her though!              3515
5856: 
5857: Faust
5858: 
5859: Would I advise it, Love, if it were so?
5860: 
5861: Margaret
5862: 
5863: Ah, I only have to see you, dearest man,
5864: And something bends me to your will,
5865: For you, so much, I have already done,
5866: Little remains for me to do for you still.         3520
5867: 
5868: (She exits.)
5869: 
5870: (Mephistopheles enters.)
5871: 
5872: The little monkey! Has it gone?
5873: 
5874: Faust
5875: 
5876:           Spying again, are you?
5877: 
5878: Mephistopheles
5879: 
5880: I’ve heard in infinite detail, how
5881: The Doctor works his catechism through,
5882: And I hope it does you good, now.
5883: Girls are always so keen to review                 3525
5884: Whether one’s virtuous, and sticks to the rules.
5885: They think if a man can be led, he’ll follow too.
5886: 
5887: Faust
5888: 
5889: Monster, you can’t see
5890: How this true loving soul,
5891: Full of a belief,                                   3530
5892: That is wholly
5893: Her salvation, torments herself so,
5894: In case her lover should be lost indeed.
5895: 
5896: Mephistopheles
5897: 
5898: You sensual wooer, beyond the sensual,
5899: A Magdalen leads you by the nose, I see.            3535
5900: 
5901: Faust
5902: 
5903: Abortion, of the filth and fire of hell!
5904: 
5905: Mephistopheles
5906: 
5907: And how well she reads one’s physiognomy:
5908: In my presence, senses, without knowing how,
5909: The hidden mind behind the mask: she feels
5910: That I’m an evil genius, at least, and now          3540
5911: Perhaps, that it’s the Devil it conceals.
5912: So, tonight? –
5913: 
5914: Faust
5915: 
5916:          What’s that to you?
5917: 
5918: Mephistopheles
5919: 
5920: I take my pleasure in it too!
5921: Part I Scene XVII: At The Fountain
5922: 
5923: (Gretchen and Lisbeth.)
5924: 
5925: Lisbeth
5926: 
5927: Have you not heard from Barbara?
5928: 
5929: Gretchen
5930: 
5931: Not a word. I go out so seldom.                3545
5932: 
5933: Lisbeth
5934: 
5935: It’s certain, Sibyl told me: well then,
5936: She finally fell to that seducer.
5937: There’s a lady for you!
5938: 
5939: Gretchen
5940: 
5941:                        How so?
5942: 
5943: Lisbeth
5944: 
5945:                                   It stinks!
5946: She’s feeding two when she eats and drinks.
5947: 
5948: Gretchen
5949: 
5950: Oh!                                            3550
5951: 
5952: Lisbeth
5953: 
5954:       Serves her right then, finally.
5955: She clung to that fellow, oh so tightly!
5956: That was a fine to-ing and fro-ing,
5957: Round the village, and dance-going,
5958: Ahead of us all, they had to shine,            3555
5959: Him treating her always to cakes and wine:
5960: She the picture of loveliness, oh so fine,
5961: So low after all, then, and so shameless,
5962: And the gifts she took from him, nameless.
5963: It was all kissing and carrying on:             3560
5964: But now the flower is gone!
5965: 
5966: Gretchen
5967: 
5968: The poor thing!
5969: 
5970: Lisbeth
5971: 
5972:               Why are you so pitying?
5973: When each of us was at our spinning,
5974: When mother never let us out,
5975: She and her lover hung about:                   3565
5976: On the bench, in a dark alley,
5977: Forgetting the time, he and she.
5978: She can’t raise her head again,
5979: In a sinner’s shift now, penitent.
5980: 
5981: Gretchen
5982: 
5983: Surely he’ll take her for his wife.             3570
5984: 
5985: Lisbeth
5986: 
5987: He’d be a fool! A lively fellow
5988: Can ply his trade elsewhere, and so -
5989: He’s gone.
5990: 
5991: Gretchen
5992:                      Oh, that’s not nice!
5993: 
5994: Lisbeth
5995: 
5996: If she gets him, she’ll reap ill in a trice,
5997: The lads will tear at her wreath, what’s more   3575
5998: We’ll scatter chaff in front of her door!
5999: (She exits.)
6000: 
6001: Gretchen (Walking home.)
6002: 
6003: How proudly I’d revile her, then,
6004: Whenever some poor girl had fallen!
6005: I couldn’t find words enough, I mean,
6006: To pour out scorn for another’s sin!         3580
6007: Black as it seemed, I made it blacker,
6008: Not black enough for me: oh never.
6009: It blessed its own being, that proud self,
6010: Yet now I’m the image of sin, myself!
6011: Yet all that drove me on to do it,           3585
6012: God! Was so fine! Oh, so sweet!
6013: Part I Scene XVIII: A Tower
6014: 
6015: (In a niche of its wall a shrine, and image of the Mater Dolorosa, with
6016: flowers in front of it. Gretchen sets out fresh flowers. )
6017: 
6018: Gretchen
6019: 
6020: Oh bow down,
6021: Sorrowful one,
6022: Your kind face, to my affliction!
6023: 
6024: A sword in your heart,                                                    3590
6025: Where a thousand pains start,
6026: You look up, at your dead Son.
6027: 
6028: You look up to the Father,
6029: You send Him your sighs, there,
6030: For His, and for your, affliction.                                        3595
6031: 
6032: Who then can feel,
6033: How like steel,
6034: Is the pain inside my bones?
6035: What my poor heart fears for,
6036: What it quakes for, and longs for                                         3600
6037: You know, and you alone!
6038: 
6039: Wherever I go now,
6040: How sore, sore, sore now
6041: How sore my heart must be!
6042: Ah, when I’m alone here,                                                  3605
6043: I moan, moan, moan here:
6044: My heart it breaks in me.
6045: 
6046: The pots before my window!
6047: My tears bedewed them so,
6048: In the early dawn, when                                                   3610
6049: I picked the flowers below.
6050: The sun it shone so brightly,
6051: And early, in my room,
6052: Where I sat already,
6053: On my bed, in deepest gloom.                        3615
6054: 
6055: Help me! Oh, save me, from shame and destruction!
6056: Oh, bow down,
6057: Sorrowful one,
6058: Your kind face, to my affliction!
6059: Part I Scene XIX: Night
6060: 
6061: (The Street in front of Gretchen’s door.)
6062: 
6063: Valentine (A soldier, Gretchen’s brother.)
6064: 
6065: When I have sat, and heard the toasts,         3620
6066: Where everyone makes good his boasts,
6067: And comrades praised, to me, the flower
6068: Of maidenhood, and loud the hour,
6069: With brimming glass that blurred the praise,
6070: And elbows sticking out all ways,              3625
6071: I sat in my own peace secure,
6072: Listening to the boastful roar,
6073: And as I stroked my beard, I’d smile
6074: And take a full glass in my hand,
6075: Saying: ‘Each to his own, but I’ll             3630
6076: Ask if there’s any in this land,
6077: Who, to my Gretel, can compare
6078: Whose worth can ever equal hers?’
6079: Hear! Hear! Clink! Clang! Went around:
6080: Some cried out: ‘He’s quite correct,           3635
6081: She’s an ornament to all her sex.’
6082: There sat the boasters, not a sound.
6083: And now! – I could tear my hair out, bawl,
6084: And dash my head against the wall! –
6085: With jeers, they now turn up their noses:      3640
6086: Every rogue can taunt me, he supposes!
6087: Like a bankrupt debtor, when I’m sitting,
6088: A casual word can start me sweating!
6089: And though I thrash them all together,
6090: I’ve still no right to call them liars.        3645
6091: 
6092: Who goes there? What’s creeping by?
6093: If I’m not wrong, there’s two I spy.
6094: If it’s him, I’ll have him by the skin,
6095: Alive he’ll not leave the place he’s in!
6096: (Faust. Mephistopheles)
6097: 
6098: Faust
6099: 
6100: How the glow of the eternal light             3650
6101: Shines from the Sacristy window, there,
6102: On either side grows fainter, fainter,
6103: And all around draws in the night!
6104: Now it seems as dark within my heart.
6105: 
6106: Mephistopheles
6107: 
6108: And I’ve a little of the tom-cat’s art,       3655
6109: That creeps around the fire escape,
6110: Then slinks along the wall, a silent shape,
6111: I’m quite virtuous in my way,
6112: A little prone to thieve, and stray.
6113: The splendour of Walpurgis Night,             3660
6114: Already haunts all my members,
6115: It’s the day after tomorrow’s light:
6116: There, why one watches, one remembers.
6117: 
6118: Faust
6119: 
6120: Meanwhile you’ll bring that wealth to view,
6121: That I see there, glimmering, behind you?     3665
6122: 
6123: Mephistopheles
6124: 
6125: You’ll soon experience the delight
6126: Of holding this cauldron to the light.
6127: I recently had a squint inside –
6128: Where splendid silver dollars hide.
6129: 
6130: Faust
6131: 
6132: And not a jewel, or a ring,                   3670
6133: To adorn my darling girl?
6134: Mephistopheles
6135: 
6136: Among the rest I saw a thing,
6137: A sort of necklace, made of pearl.
6138: 
6139: Faust
6140: 
6141: That’s good! It’s painful to me,
6142: To take no gift for her to see.         3675
6143: 
6144: Mephistopheles
6145: 
6146: You shouldn’t find it so annoying,
6147: To get something now, for nothing.
6148: Now the sky glows, filled with stars,
6149: You’ll hear the work of a master:
6150: I’ll sing a few moralising bars,        3680
6151: All the better to seduce her.
6152: 
6153: (Sings to the zither.)
6154: 
6155: ‘Why are you here,
6156: Katrina dear,
6157: In daylight clear,
6158: At your lover’s door?                   3685
6159: No, no! Not when,
6160: It will let in,
6161: A maid, and then,
6162: Let out a maid no more!
6163: 
6164: 
6165: Take care: for once                     3690
6166: It’s over and done,
6167: And it’s all gone,
6168: Goodnight to you, poor thing!
6169: Keep love’s belief,
6170: And pleasure brief,
6171: From every thief,                       3695
6172: Unless you’ve a wedding ring.’
6173: Valentine (Approaching.)
6174: 
6175: Whom do you lure? By every element!
6176: You evil-tongued rat-catcher!
6177: To the devil, with your instrument!                3700
6178: To the devil, too, with the singer!
6179: 
6180: Mephistopheles
6181: 
6182: The zither’s broken! There’s nothing left of it.
6183: 
6184: Valentine
6185: 
6186: There’s a still a skull left I’ll need to split!
6187: 
6188: Mephistopheles (To Faust.)
6189: 
6190: Look lively, Doctor! Don’t give ground.
6191: Stand by: I’ll command this thing.                 3705
6192: Out with your fly-whisk, now.
6193: You lunge! I’m parrying.
6194: 
6195: Valentine
6196: 
6197: Parry, then!
6198: 
6199: Mephistopheles
6200: 
6201:                       And why not, indeed?
6202: 
6203: Valentine
6204: 
6205: And that!
6206: 
6207: Mephistopheles
6208: 
6209:          Ah, yes!
6210: Valentine
6211: 
6212:                 The devil opposes me!
6213: What’s this? My hand’s already maimed.               3710
6214: 
6215: Mephistopheles (To Faust.)
6216: 
6217: Thrust, home!
6218: 
6219: Valentine (Falls.)
6220: 
6221:              Ah!
6222: 
6223: Mephistopheles
6224: 
6225:                   Now, the lout is tamed!
6226: Away, we must go! Swiftly, of course,
6227: Soon the cries of murder will begin,
6228: With the police, now, I’m well in:
6229: But not so much so with the courts.                  3715
6230: 
6231: (He exits with Faust.)
6232: 
6233: Martha (At the window.)
6234: 
6235: Come here! Come here!
6236: 
6237: Gretchen (At the window.)
6238: 
6239:                                    Here’s a light!
6240: 
6241: Martha
6242: 
6243: Hear how they swear and struggle, yell and fight.
6244: 
6245: On-lookers
6246: 
6247: Here’s one dead already!
6248: Martha (Leaving the house.)
6249: 
6250: Where have the murderers gone?
6251: 
6252: Gretchen (Leaving the house.)
6253: 
6254: Who is it, lying there?
6255: 
6256: On-lookers
6257: 
6258:              Your mother’s son.         3720
6259: 
6260: Gretchen
6261: 
6262: Almighty God! What misery!
6263: 
6264: Valentine
6265: 
6266: I’m dying! That’s soon spoken,
6267: And, sooner still, it will be done.
6268: Why stand there, crying, woman?
6269: Come, hear me everyone!                 3725
6270: 
6271: (They gather round him.)
6272: 
6273: You’re still young, my Gretchen, see!
6274: And still haven’t sense enough, to be
6275: Effective in your occupation.
6276: I’ll tell you confidentially:
6277: Now that you’re a whore indeed,         3730
6278: Be one, by proclamation!
6279: 
6280: Gretchen
6281: 
6282: My brother! God! Why speak to me so?
6283: 
6284: Valentine
6285: 
6286: In this business, leave God alone!
6287: Sadly, what is done is done,
6288: And what will come: will come.               3735
6289: Begin with one, in secret, then,
6290: Soon you’ll gather other men,
6291: And, when a dozen of them have had you,
6292: All the town can have you too.
6293: When Shame herself appears,                  3740
6294: She’s first brought secretly to light,
6295: Then they draw the veil of night
6296: Over both her eyes and ears:
6297: Men would gladly kill her, I say,
6298: But they let her walk about and prosper,     3745
6299: So she goes nakedly by day,
6300: Yet isn’t any lovelier.
6301: She’s the uglier to our sight,
6302: The more it is she seeks the light.
6303: Truly I can see the day                      3750
6304: When all honest people
6305: Will turn aside from you, girl,
6306: As from a corpse with plague.
6307: Your heart’s flesh will despair,
6308: When they look you in the face,              3755
6309: You’ll have no golden chain to wear!
6310: At the altar, there, you’ll have no place!
6311: You’ll not be dancing joyfully
6312: In all your lovely finery!
6313: In some wretched gloomy corner, you          3760
6314: Will hide, with cripples and beggars too,
6315: And, though God may still forgive,
6316: Be damned on earth while you live!
6317: 
6318: Martha
6319: 
6320: Commend your soul to God’s mercy!
6321: Will you end your life with blasphemy?       3765
6322: Valentine
6323: 
6324: If I could destroy your withered body,
6325: Shameless, bawd, I’d hope to see
6326: A full measure of forgiveness
6327: For me, and all my sinfulness.
6328: 
6329: Gretchen
6330: 
6331: My brother! These are the pains of hell!   3770
6332: 
6333: Valentine
6334: 
6335: I said, leave off weeping, girl!
6336: When you and honour chose to part,
6337: That was the sword-thrust in my heart.
6338: I go, through a sleep within the grave,
6339: To God, as a soldier, true and brave.      3775

6347: 
6348: The Evil Spirit
6349: 
6350: How different it was, Gretchen,
6351: When you, still innocent,
6352: Came here to the altar,
6353: And from that well-thumbed Book,
6354: Babbled your prayers,                                               3780
6355: Half, a childish game,
6356: Half, God in your heart!
6357: Gretchen!
6358: What’s in your mind?
6359: In your heart,                                                      3785
6360: What crime?
6361: Do you pray for your mother’s soul, who
6362: Through you, fell asleep to long, long torment?
6363: Whose blood is on your doorstep?
6364: And beneath your heart,                                             3790
6365: Does not something stir and swell,
6366: And trouble you, and itself,
6367: A presence full of foreboding?
6368: 
6369: Gretchen
6370: 
6371: Oh! Oh!
6372: Would I were free of the thoughts                                   3795
6373: That rush here and there inside me,
6374: Despite myself!

6386: The trumpet sounds!
6387: The grave trembles!
6388: And your heart,
6389: From ashen rest,
6390: To fiery torment                                                     3805
6391: Brought again,
6392: Shudders!
6393: 
6394: Gretchen
6395: 
6396: Would I were not here!
6397: It seems to me as if the organ
6398: Steals my breath,                                                    3810

6454: 
6455: Mephistopheles
6456: 
6457: Don’t you just long for a broomstick?                         3835
6458: I wish I’d the sturdiest goat to ride.
6459: Like this, the journey’s not so quick.
6460: 
6461: Faust
6462: 
6463: So long as my legs can do the trick,
6464: This knotted stick will do me fine.
6465: Why do we need a shorter way! –                               3840
6466: To wander this labyrinth of valleys,
6467: Climb all these cliffs and gullies,
6468: From which the waters ever spray,
6469: That’s a delight enchants the day!
6470: Spring stirs already in the birches,                          3845
6471: And even the fir tree knows it now:
6472: Shouldn’t our limbs feel it search us?
6473: 
6474: Mephistopheles
6475: 
6476: Truly, I don’t feel a thing!
6477: It’s winter in my body, still,
6478: On my path I want it frosty, snowing.                         3850
6479: How sadly the Moon’s imperfect circle
6480: With its red belated glow, is rising,
6481: So dim its light that at every step
6482: You scrape a rock, or else a tree!
6483: Ah, there, a will o’ the wisp leapt!                          3855
6484: It’s burning fiercely, now, I see.
6485: Hey! My friend! May I ask your aid?
6486: Would you like to give us a blaze?
6487: Be so good as to light us up the hill!
6488: Will O’ The Wisp
6489: 
6490: With respect, I hope I’ll still be able,                         3860
6491: To keep my Natural light quite stable:
6492: We usually zig-zag here, at will.
6493: 
6494: Mephistopheles
6495: 
6496: Ha, ha! He thinks to play the human game.
6497: Go straight along now, in the Devil’s name!
6498: Or I’ll blow out your flickering spark!                          3865
6499: 
6500: Will O’ The Wisp
6501: 
6502: You’re master of the house, I’ll remark,
6503: And yes, I’ll serve you willingly.
6504: But think! The mount is magically mad today,
6505: And if a will o’ the wisp should lead the way,
6506: You mustn’t judge things too precisely.                          3870
6507: 
6508: Faust, Mephistopheles, The Will O’ The Wisp (In alternating song.)
6509: 
6510: We it seems, now find ourselves.
6511: In the sphere of dreams and magic,
6512: Do us honour, guide us well
6513: So our journey will be quick,
6514: Through the wide, deserted spaces!                               3875
6515: Tree on tree now shift their places,
6516: See how fast they open to us
6517: And the cliffs bow down before us,
6518: And their long and rocky noses,
6519: How they whistle and blow, for us!                               3880
6520: Through the stones, and through the grasses,
6521: Stream and streamlet, downward, hurrying.
6522: Is that rustling? Is that singing?
6523: Do I hear sweet lovers’ sighing,
6524: Heavenly days, is that their babbling?                           3885
6525: What we hope for, what we love!
6526: And the echoes, like the murmuring
6527: Of those other days, are ringing.
6528: ‘Too-wit! Too-woo!’ sounding nearer,
6529: Owl there, and jay, and plover,            3890
6530: Are they all awake above?
6531: A salamander in the scrub, he’s
6532: Long of leg, and fat of belly!
6533: And every root like a snake,
6534: Over sand and rock all bent,               3895
6535: Stretches with a strange intent,
6536: To scare us, of us prisoners make:
6537: From the gnarled and living mass,
6538: Stretching towards those who pass,
6539: Fibrous tentacles. And mice                3900
6540: Multi-coloured, lemming-wise,
6541: In the moss and in the heather!
6542: And all the fire-flies glowing,
6543: Crushed together, tightly crowding,
6544: In their tangled cohorts gather.           3905
6545: Tell me, are we standing still,
6546: Or are we climbing up the hill?
6547: All seems spinning like a mill,
6548: Rocks and trees, with angry faces
6549: Lights, now, wandering in spaces,          3910
6550: Massing: swelling at their will.
6551: 
6552: Mephistopheles
6553: 
6554: Grasp me bravely by the coat-tail!
6555: Here’s a summit in the middle,
6556: Where, astonished you can see,
6557: Mammon glowing furiously.                  3915
6558: 
6559: Faust
6560: 
6561: How strangely, through the hollow, glows
6562: A sort of dull red morning light!
6563: Into the deepest gorge it flows,
6564: Scenting abysses in their night.
6565: There vapour rises: here cloud sweeps,     3920
6566: Here the glow burns through the haze,
6567: Now like a fragile thread it creeps,
6568: Now like a coloured fountain plays.
6569: Here a vast length winds its way,
6570: In a hundred veins, down the vales,       3925
6571: And here in a corner, locked away,
6572: All at once, now lonely, fails.
6573: Nearby the sparks pour down,
6574: Like showers of golden sand,
6575: But see! On all the heights around,       3930
6576: The cliffs, now incandescent, stand.
6577: 
6578: Mephistopheles
6579: 
6580: Has Mammon not lit his palace
6581: Splendidly, for this festivity?
6582: It’s fortunate you’re here to see,
6583: I already sense the eager guests.         3935
6584: 
6585: Faust
6586: 
6587: How the wind roars through the air!
6588: And whips around my head!
6589: 
6590: Mephistopheles
6591: 
6592: Grasp the ancient stony bed,
6593: Lest you’re thrown in the abyss, there.
6594: Mist dims the night to deepest black.     3940
6595: Hear the forest timbers crack!
6596: The owls are flying off in terror.
6597: Hear, how the columns shatter,
6598: In the vast, evergreen halls.
6599: Now the boughs groan and fall!            3945
6600: All the tree-trunks are thrumming!
6601: All their roots are creaking, gaping!
6602: Sinking in a tangled horror,
6603: Crashing down on each other,
6604: And through the ruined gorges             3950
6605: The wind howls and surges.
6606: Hear the voices on the heights?
6607: Far away, and then nearby?
6608: Yes, a furious magic song
6609: Sweeps the mountain, all along!            3955
6610: 
6611: Witches (In chorus.)
6612: 
6613: To Brocken’s tip the witches stream,
6614: The stubble’s yellow, the seed is green.
6615: There the crowd of us will meet.
6616: Lord Urian has the highest seat.
6617: So they go, over stone and sticks,         3960
6618: The stinking goat, the farting witch.
6619: 
6620: A Voice
6621: 
6622: Old Baubo comes, alone, and how:
6623: She’s riding on a mother-sow.
6624: 
6625: Chorus
6626: 
6627: So honour then, where honour’s due!
6628: Baubo, goes first! Then, all the crew!     3965
6629: A tough old sow, a mother proud,
6630: Then follow, all the witches’ crowd.
6631: 
6632: A voice
6633: 
6634: Which way did you come?
6635: 
6636: A voice
6637: 
6638:                 By the Ilsen Stone!
6639: I gazed at the owl in her nest alone.
6640: What a pair of Eyes she made!              3970
6641: 
6642: A Voice
6643: 
6644: O, all you who to Hell’s gate go!
6645: Why ride there so quickly though?
6646: A Voice
6647: 
6648: She’s driven me hard: oh, see,
6649: The wounds, all over me!
6650: 
6651: Witches, Chorus
6652: 
6653: The way is broad: the way is long.
6654: Where is this mad yearning from?
6655: The fork will prick, the broom will scratch,
6656: The child will smother: the mother crack.
6657: 
6658: Wizards, Half-Chorus
6659: 
6660: Like snails in their shells, we’re crawlers,
6661: All the women are there before us.
6662: At the House of Evil, when we’re callers,      3980
6663: Woman’s a thousand steps before us.
6664: 
6665: The Other Half
6666: 
6667: We don’t measure with so much care,
6668: In a thousand steps a Woman’s there.
6669: But make whatever speed she can,
6670: A single leap, and there is Man.               3985
6671: 
6672: Voice (From above.)

6680: But we’re unfruitful still, forever.
6681: Both Choruses
6682: 
6683: The wind is quiet: a star shoots by,      3990
6684: The shadowy Moon departs the sky.
6685: The magic choir’s a rush of sparks,
6686: Thousands shower through the dark.

6697: 
6698: Take me with you! Take me with you!
6699: Climbing for three hundred years,
6700: I haven’t reached the summit yet,
6701: I long to be where my peers are met.
6702: 
6703: Both Choruses
6704: 
6705: Here’s the broom: and here’s the stick,   4000
6706: The ram is here, the fork to prick.
6707: Tonight, whoever can’t deliver
6708: There’s a man is lost forever.
6709: 
6710: Half-witches (Below.)
6711: 
6712: I’ve stumbled round so long, down here:
6713: How far ahead the rest appear!            4005
6714: I get no peace around the house,
6715: And get none either hereabouts.
6716: Chorus of Witches
6717: 
6718: An ointment makes the witches hale:
6719: A rag will do them for a sail,
6720: A trough’s a goodly ship, and tight:                 4010
6721: He’ll fly not who flies not tonight.
6722: 
6723: Both Choruses
6724: 
6725: And once we’ve soared around,
6726: So, alight then, on the ground,
6727: Cover the heather, far and wide,
6728: With your swarming witches’ tide.                    4015
6729: 
6730: (They let themselves fall.)
6731: 
6732: Mephistopheles
6733: 
6734: They push and shove, they roar and clatter!
6735: They whistle and whirl, jostle and chatter!
6736: They glimmer and sparkle, stink and flare!
6737: The genuine witch-element’s there!
6738: We’ll soon be parted, so stay near!                  4020
6739: Where are you?
6740: 
6741: Faust (In the distance.)
6742:                               Here!
6743: 
6744: Mephistopheles
6745: 
6746:             What! Nearly out of sight?
6747: Then I’ll have to use a master’s right.
6748: Ground! Sir Voland comes. Sweet folk, give ground!
6749: Here, Doctor, hold tight! In a single bound,
6750: Far from the crowd, we’ll soon be free:              4025
6751: It’s too much, even for the likes of me.
6752: Something burned there with a special light,
6753: In that thicket, as far then as I could see,
6754: Come on! We can slip inside, all right.
6755: Faust
6756: 
6757: You spirit of contradiction! Go on! I follow you.   4030
6758: I think after all it’s worked out quite cleverly:
6759: We walk the Brocken on Walpurgis Night, yet we
6760: Are as isolated now, as we ever could choose.
6761: 
6762: Mephistopheles
6763: 
6764: See now, what colours flare!
6765: A lively mob club together there.                   4035
6766: In little groups one’s not alone.
6767: 
6768: Faust
6769: 
6770: I’d still rather be higher, though!
6771: I can see fire and whirling smoke.
6772: There the crowd stream, to the Evil One:
6773: There many a puzzle finds solution.                 4040
6774: 
6775: Mephistopheles
6776: 
6777: But many a puzzle’s knotted so.
6778: Let the whole world have its riot,
6779: Here we’ll house ourselves in quiet.
6780: It’s a long and well-established tradition,
6781: From the great one makes a smaller edition.         4045
6782: I see young witches, naked, bare,
6783: And old ones, veiled cunningly.
6784: For my sake, be a little friendly.
6785: The trouble’s slight, the fun is rare.
6786: I hear instruments being tuned, too!                4050
6787: A cursed din, you’ll soon get used to.
6788: Come, with me! There’s no way otherwise,
6789: I’ll step ahead, lead you to their eyes,
6790: And earn your fresh gratitude, so.
6791: What say you? There’s lots of room, my friend.      4055
6792: Look over there! You can’t see its end.
6793: A hundred fires burning, in a row,
6794: They love, and drink, and dance, and chat,
6795: Tell me where you’ll find better than that?
6796: 
6797: Faust
6798: 
6799: Will you, as we make our bow,                     4060
6800: Play the devil, or wizard now?
6801: 
6802: Mephistopheles
6803: 
6804: To be sure I’m used to travelling incognito,
6805: But on formal occasions rank’s allowed to show.
6806: I’ve no Knight’s garter to mark me out,
6807: But the cloven foot’s honoured in this house.     4065
6808: Do you see how that snail there crawls to me:
6809: With those delicate feelers on its head,
6810: It’s already scented me, you see,
6811: I can’t deny myself, if I wished.
6812: Come! We’ll go from fire to fire,                 4070
6813: I’m the broker: you’re the suitor.
6814: 
6815: (To some, sitting by dying embers.)
6816: 
6817: Old sirs, what do you sit at the edge for?
6818: I’d praise you, in the middle, more,
6819: Among the youthful buzz, and shout.
6820: You’re alone enough inside the house.             4075
6821: 
6822: The General
6823: 
6824: Who would trust the Nation!
6825: One’s toiled so long for it:
6826: With the people, as with women,
6827: Youth’s always the best fit.
6828: 
6829: The Minister
6830: 
6831: From every rule they’ve gone astray,              4080
6832: Me, I praise the good old days,
6833: Then, truly, we were all the rage,
6834: That was a real golden age.
6835: The Nouveau Riche
6836: 
6837: We weren’t so stupid, you’d have found,
6838: And often did, what wasn’t right:               4085
6839: But now it all turns round and round,
6840: Just as we’d like to grasp it tight.
6841: 
6842: Author
6843: 
6844: Who writes anything good these days,
6845: Or reads with moderate intelligence!
6846: And what the dear young folk all praise,        4090
6847: I’ve never seen such stupid nonsense.
6848: 
6849: Mephistopheles (Suddenly looking old.)
6850: 
6851: I feel folk are ripe for Judgement Day,
6852: Of Witches’ Mount, I’ve made my last ascent.
6853: And now my cask runs cloudy, anyway,
6854: The world itself is all as good as spent.       4095
6855: 
6856: Witch-Marketeer
6857: 
6858: Gentlemen: don’t pass me by!
6859: Don’t lose the opportunity!
6860: Inspect my wares attentively,
6861: I’ve a selection for your eye.
6862: There’s nothing on my stall, here,              4100
6863: On Earth, it’s equal you’ll not find,
6864: That hasn’t caused some harm somewhere,
6865: To the world itself, and then, mankind.
6866: No knife that isn’t dyed in gore,
6867: No cup that, through some healthy body,         4105
6868: Hot, gnawing venom hasn’t poured,
6869: No gems that haven’t bought some kindly
6870: Girl, no sword that’s not cut ties that bind,
6871: Or, perhaps, struck an enemy from behind.
6872: Mephistopheles
6873: 
6874: Granny! You misunderstand the age.                   4110
6875: What’s gone: is done! What’s done: is gone!
6876: Get novelties they’re all the rage!
6877: Now it’s novelties that lead us on.
6878: 
6879: Faust
6880: 
6881: Don’t let me lose myself in here!
6882: Now, this is what I call a fair!                     4115
6883: 
6884: Mephistopheles
6885: 
6886: This whole whirlpool’s trying to climb above,
6887: You think you’re shoving, and you’re being shoved!
6888: 
6889: Faust
6890: 
6891: Who is that, there?
6892: 
6893: Mephistopheles
6894: 
6895:              Note that madam!
6896: That’s Lilith.
6897: 
6898: Faust
6899:             Who?
6900: 
6901: Mephistopheles
6902: 
6903:             First wife to Adam.
6904: Pay attention to her lovely hair,                    4120
6905: The only adornment she need wear.
6906: When she traps a young man in her snare,
6907: She won’t soon let him from her care.
6908: Faust
6909: 
6910: Those two, the old and young one, sitting,
6911: They’ve leapt about more than is fitting!      4125
6912: 
6913: Mephistopheles
6914: 
6915: No rest tonight for anyone.
6916: Let’s grasp them. There’s a new dance, come!
6917: 
6918: Faust (Dancing with the lovely young witch.)
6919: 
6920: A lovely dream once came to me,
6921: And there I saw an apple-tree,
6922: Two lovely apples, there, did shine,           4130
6923: Tempting me so, I had to climb.
6924: 
6925: The Young Witch
6926: 
6927: Apples you love a lot, I know,
6928: That once in Paradise did grow.
6929: I’m deeply moved with joy to feel,
6930: That such my garden does reveal.               4135
6931: 
6932: Mephistopheles (Dancing with the old witch.)
6933: 
6934: A vile dream once came to me,
6935: In it, I saw an old cleft tree,
6936: A monstrous crack there met my eyes,
6937: It pleased me, though, despite its size.
6938: 
6939: The Old Witch
6940: 
6941: I offer my best greetings to                   4140
6942: The knight of the cloven shoe!
6943: He’ll need to have a real stopper,
6944: If he’s not scared of that whopper.
6945: A Rationalist (Nicolai)
6946: 
6947: Cursed Folk! How do you dare to?
6948: Haven’t we shown, for many a season,                     4145
6949: Spirits can’t exist: it stands to reason?
6950: Yet you dance around, just as we do!
6951: 
6952: The Lovely Witch (Dancing.)
6953: 
6954: Why’s he here then, at our ball?
6955: 
6956: Faust (Dancing.)
6957: 
6958: Oh! He’s everywhere, and into all.
6959: While others dance, he must reflect.                     4150
6960: If he can’t discuss every last step,
6961: It’s as good as if it didn’t happen.
6962: He’s angriest at a forward pattern.
6963: But if you turn around in circles,
6964: As he does in his ancient mills,                         4155
6965: He’ll call it excellent, least ways
6966: If you greet with interest what he says.
6967: 
6968: The Rationalist
6969: 
6970: You’re still there! Oh, it’s quite unheard of.
6971: We’re enlightened now, so take yourselves off!
6972: The Devil’s crew’s discounted by every rule:             4160
6973: Yet though clever, still we’re haunted, in Tegel, too.
6974: 
6975: The Young Witch
6976: 
6977: Well listen: here we’re bored with it!
6978: 
6979: The Rationalist
6980: 
6981: I tell you, Spirit, to your face:                        4165
6982: For me, spirit-rule has no place:
6983: Because my spirit can’t exercise it.
6984: (The dance continues.)
6985: 
6986: I see, tonight, I’ll have no success:
6987: But I get a bit from every trip,
6988: And hope, before the final step,              4170
6989: I’ll defeat the devils and the poets.
6990: 
6991: Mephistopheles
6992: 
6993: Now he’ll sit in some wet sump,
6994: And console himself, like that, about you,
6995: And if he sticks leeches on his rump,
6996: He’s cured of the Spirit, and Spirits, too.   4175
6997: 
6998: (To Faust, who has left the dance.)
6999: 
7000: Why have you deserted that lovely girl,
7001: Who sang so sweetly in the dancing?
7002: 
7003: Faust
7004: 
7005: Ugh! Right in the middle of her singing
7006: A red mouse sprang out of her mouth.
7007: 
7008: Mephistopheles
7009: 
7010: That’s fine: don’t brood on it, anyway:       4180
7011: Enough, that the mouse wasn’t grey.
7012: At harvest time who queries a mouse?
7013: 
7014: Faust
7015: 
7016: Then I saw –
7017: 
7018: Mephistopheles
7019: 
7020:                     What?
7021: Faust
7022: 
7023:                 Mephisto, can you see
7024: That lovely child, far off, alone there,        4185
7025: Travelling slowly, so painfully,
7026: As if her feet were chained together.
7027: I must admit, without question
7028: She’s the image of my sweet Gretchen.
7029: 
7030: Mephistopheles
7031: 
7032: Forget all that! It benefits no one.
7033: It’s a lifeless magic form, a phantom.          4190
7034: Encountering it will do you no good:
7035: Its fixed stare freezes human blood,
7036: And then one’s almost turned to stone:
7037: Medusa’s story is surely known.
7038: 
7039: Faust
7040: 
7041: Those are the eyes of the dead, truly,          4195
7042: No loving hand has closed their void.
7043: That’s the breast Gretchen offered to me:
7044: That’s the sweet body I enjoyed.
7045: 
7046: Mephistopheles
7047: 
7048: It’s magic, fool: you’re an easy one to move!
7049: She comes to all, as if she were their love.    4200
7050: 
7051: Faust
7052: 
7053: What delight! What pain!
7054: I can’t turn from her, again.
7055: Strange, around her lovely throat,
7056: A single scarlet cord adorns her,
7057: Like a knife-cut, and no wider!                 4205
7058: Mephistopheles
7059: 
7060: That’s right! I see it too: and note,
7061: She can carry her head under her arm,
7062: Since Perseus did her that fatal harm.
7063: Always desire for that illusion!
7064: Come on, climb this bit of mountain:        4210
7065: It’s as lively as the Vienna Prater,
7066: And if no one’s deceiving me,
7067: I’m looking at a genuine theatre.
7068: You’re showing?
7069: 
7070: Servibilis
7071: 
7072:            It’ll be on again shortly.
7073: A fresh performance: last of seven.         4215
7074: That number, for us, is traditional.
7075: An amateur’s written it, and then
7076: It’s amateurs who perform it all.
7077: Forgive me, sir, if I break off here,
7078: Since I’m the amateur curtain-raiser.       4220
7079: 
7080: Mephistopheles
7081: 
7082: That I find you on the Blocksberg’s good,
7083: Since I find you exactly where I should.
7084: Part I Scene XXII: A Walpurgis Night’s Dream
7085: 
7086:                            Or
7087: 
7088:          Oberon and Titania’s Golden Wedding.
7089: 
7090:              An Interlude (Intermezzo)
7091: 
7092: Theatre Manager
7093: 
7094: You brave stagehands, of Weimar,
7095: Take a rest, at least for today.
7096: Ancient mountains, misty vales are,             4225
7097: All the scenery for our play.
7098: 
7099: Herald
7100: 
7101: Fifty years we’ve passed by,
7102: To make this wedding golden,
7103: But let some argument arise:
7104: There’s gold in it, for me, then.               4230
7105: 
7106: Oberon
7107: 
7108: Spirits, where I am, be seen:
7109: Appear, all, at this moment:
7110: Fairy King, and Fairy Queen,
7111: Renew their old intent.
7112: 
7113: Puck
7114: 
7115: Puck comes shooting through the air,            4235
7116: And moves his feet, in time:
7117: After him a hundred, there,
7118: Share his joyful rhyme.
7119: Ariel
7120: 
7121: Ariel conducts his singing
7122: In pure and heavenly tones:               4240
7123: Ugly faces greet its ringing,
7124: But also lovely ones.
7125: 
7126: Oberon
7127: 
7128: Partners if you’d get along,
7129: Learn then from the two of us!
7130: If we in pairs would love for long,       4245
7131: Someone needs to separate us.
7132: 
7133: Titania
7134: 
7135: The sulky man, the wilful wife,
7136: So they might know each other,
7137: I’d show him all the Northern ice,
7138: And show her the Equator.                 4250
7139: 
7140: The Whole Orchestra (Tutti. Very loud.)
7141: 
7142: From fly-snout and midge-nose,
7143: And all of their relations,
7144: Frog and cricket, too, there flow
7145: These musical vibrations!
7146: 
7147: Solo
7148: 
7149: See, the bagpipes on their way!           4255
7150: Made from a soap-bubble.
7151: Hear the snail’s-twaddle play
7152: Through its stumpy nozzle.
7153: Spirit (Newly formed.)
7154: 
7155: Spider’s-feet and toad’s-belly,
7156: With useless winglets to ’em!
7157: A little creature, it can’t be
7158: But it makes a little poem.
7159: 
7160: A Tiny Couple
7161: 
7162: Little steps and high leaps,
7163: Through honeydew and fragrance here,
7164: You still won’t do enough it seems,    4265
7165: To climb into the atmosphere.
7166: 
7167: A Curious Traveller
7168: 
7169: A masquerade of mockery?
7170: Do I dare to trust my eyes?
7171: Oberon, that fair divinity,
7172: Do I see him here, tonight?            4270
7173: 
7174: The Orthodox
7175: 
7176: He’s no tail, and not a claw!
7177: And yet it’s him, it’s true:
7178: Like the gods of Greece, I’m sure,
7179: He must be a devil too.
7180: 
7181: Northern Artist
7182: 
7183: What I capture here today,             4275
7184: In truth is only sketchy:
7185: Yet I prepare myself, someday
7186: For my Italian journey.
7187: Purist
7188: 
7189: Ah! My bad luck brings me here:
7190: Since I haven’t been invited!             4280
7191: Of all the witches to appear,
7192: Only two are powdered.
7193: 
7194: Young Witch
7195: 
7196: Powder like a petticoat
7197: On an old, grey witch you’ll see,
7198: While I sit naked on my goat,             4285
7199: And show a fine young body.
7200: 
7201: Married Woman
7202: 
7203: We have too much experience,
7204: To moan about you, here, then!
7205: Yet, as young and tender you are, once,
7206: So, I hope you will be, rotten.           4290
7207: 
7208: Orchestral Conductor
7209: 
7210: Fly-snout and midge-nose,
7211: Don’t swarm around the naked!
7212: Frog and cricket, too, all know
7213: Your time, and don’t mistake it!
7214: 
7215: A Wind-Vane (Swinging to one side.)
7216: 
7217: Society, as one would like it done:       4295
7218: True pure brides along the slope!
7219: And young fellows, one for one,
7220: People quite brimful of hope!
7221: The Wind-Vane (Swinging to the other side.)
7222: 
7223: And if the ground doesn’t split,
7224: And swallow everyone,                                           4300
7225: I’ll be so amazed at it,
7226: I’ll leap into hell at once.
7227: 
7228: Xenies (Barbed verses: Greek – gifts exchanged.)
7229: 
7230: As insects we appear,
7231: With little claws we’re nipping,
7232: To do Satan, our Papa,                                          4305
7233: Due honour as is fitting.
7234: 
7235: Hennings (August Von Hennings, a literary enemy.)
7236: 
7237: See them, packed in a crowd,
7238: Naïve, together, poking fun!
7239: At last, they’ll even say, aloud,
7240: Their hearts were blameless ones.                               4310
7241: 
7242: Musagete (Controller of the Muses: Greek – epithet of Apollo)
7243: 
7244: Among this witches’ crew,
7245: I’d gladly lose my way:
7246: They’re easier to manage, too
7247: Than Muses, any day.
7248: 
7249: Former ‘Genius of the Age’
7250: 
7251: One was someone, among real folk.                               4315
7252: Come on, then: I can hold my end up!
7253: Like Germany’s Parnassus, look,
7254: The Blocksberg’s summit’s broad enough.
7255: Curious Traveller (Nicolai)
7256: 
7257: Say, who’s that haughty man?
7258: He walks with such proud steps.              4320
7259: He sniffs as only a sniffer-out can.
7260: ‘He smells out Jesuits.’
7261: 
7262: A Crane (Lavater)
7263: 
7264: I like to fish among the clear
7265: And the muddy levels:
7266: So the pious man appears                     4325
7267: Mixing with the devils.
7268: 
7269: A Child of This World (Goethe himself.)
7270: 
7271: To the pious man, as I’m aware,
7272: Every place is fitting,
7273: So you build, on the Blocksberg here,
7274: Many a house of meeting.                     4330
7275: 
7276: A Dancer
7277: 
7278: Does some new choir succeed?
7279: I hear a distant drum.
7280: ‘No! It’s the booming in the reeds,
7281: Of bitterns, in unison.’
7282: 
7283: A Dancing Master
7284: 
7285: How they lift their legs, this lot!          4335
7286: As best they can, they all take flight!
7287: The cripples skip, the clumsy hop,
7288: And don’t care at all what they look like.
7289: A Fiddle-Player
7290: 
7291: The ragged mob all hate so much,
7292: They’d gladly crush the others.      4340
7293: Here the bagpipe draws them, just
7294: As Orpheus’ lyre the creatures.
7295: 
7296: The Dogmatist
7297: 
7298: I won’t declare it’s madness, now,
7299: Or show myself too critical.
7300: The devil must exist somehow,        4345
7301: Or how could we act the devil?
7302: 
7303: The Idealist
7304: 
7305: The fantasy in my mind,
7306: For once, is too despotic.
7307: Truly, if I am all, I find
7308: Today I’m idiotic!                   4350
7309: 
7310: The Realist
7311: 
7312: Here’s real pain, at hand,
7313: It annoys me so to see it:
7314: For the first time, here I stand,
7315: Unsteady, on my feet.
7316: 
7317: A Believer in the Supernatural
7318: 
7319: It’s very pleasant to be here,       4355
7320: And this crowd too has merit:
7321: Since from the devil I infer
7322: Some much more virtuous spirit.
7323: A Sceptic
7324: 
7325: These little flames a-hunting go,
7326: And think they’re near the treasure:   4360
7327: But Devil rhymes with doubtful: so
7328: My being here’s a pleasure.
7329: 
7330: Orchestral Conductor
7331: 
7332: Frog on leaf, and cricket, oh
7333: You amateur editions!
7334: Fly-snout and midge-nose,              4365
7335: Remember you’re musicians!
7336: 
7337: The Skilful
7338: 
7339: Carefree, is what they call
7340: This band of happy creatures:
7341: When we can’t go on foot at all
7342: Our head it is that features.          4370
7343: 
7344: The Maladroit
7345: 
7346: We picked up many a titbit once,
7347: But now, God orders things so,
7348: Our shoes are ragged from the dance,
7349: And we travel on naked soles.
7350: 
7351: Will-O’-The-Wisps
7352: 
7353: From the swamps we’ve come,            4375
7354: Where we first arose:
7355: In the ranks here, we, at once,
7356: As glittering gallants pose.
7357: A Shooting Star
7358: 
7359: I shoot here from the sky
7360: And star- and firelight meet.          4380
7361: Now across the grass I lie -
7362: Who’ll help me to my feet?
7363: 
7364: The Heavy-Footed
7365: 
7366: Room, round about us, room!
7367: We crush the grasses under.
7368: Spirits come, and spirits too          4385
7369: Have their bulky members.
7370: 
7371: Puck
7372: 
7373: Don’t tread so heavily,
7374: Like elephantine calves: let
7375: Puck himself, the sturdy, be,
7376: On this night, the stoutest.           4390
7377: 
7378: Ariel
7379: 
7380: Loving nature winged your backs,
7381: You spirits, one supposes,
7382: Follow, then, on my light track,
7383: To the hill of roses!
7384: 
7385: Orchestra (Quietly: pianissimo)
7386: 
7387: Trailing cloud, and misted trees,      4395
7388: Brighten with the day.
7389: Breeze in leaves, and wind in reeds,
7390: And all have flown away.
7391: Part I Scene XXIII: Gloomy Day
7392: 
7393: (A Field. Faust, Mephistopheles.)
7394: 
7395: Faust
7396: 
7397: In misery! Despair! Wandering wretchedly on the face of the earth, for ages,
7398: and now imprisoned! That kind, unfortunate creature, locked up in prison as
7399: a criminal, and lost in torment! To this! This! – Treacherous, worthless
7400: spirit, you hid it from me! – Stand there, then! Roll the devil’s eyes in your
7401: head, in anger! Stand there, and defy me with your unbearable presence!
7402: Imprisoned! In irredeemable misery! Delivered up to evil spirits, and the
7403: judgement of unfeeling men! And you’ve troubled me meanwhile with
7404: tasteless diversions, concealed her growing misery from me, and left her
7405: helpless in the face of ruin!
7406: 
7407: Mephistopheles
7408: 
7409: She is not the first.
7410: 
7411: Faust
7412: 
7413: Dog! Loathsome Monster! – Change him, infinite Spirit! Change the worm
7414: into his dog-form, in which he often liked to scamper in front of me, at
7415: night, rolling at the feet of the unsuspecting traveller, and clambering on his
7416: shoulders when he fell. Change him into his favourite likeness, so he can
7417: crawl on his belly in the sand in front of me, and I can trample him,
7418: depraved thing, under my feet! – ‘Not the first!’ – Misery! Misery! That no
7419: human spirit can grasp. That more than one being should sink into the depth
7420: of this wretchedness: that the first, writhing in its death-pangs, under the
7421: eyes of Eternal Forgiveness, did not expiate the guilt of all the others! It
7422: pierces to the marrow of my bones, the misery of this one being – and you
7423: smile calmly at the fate of thousands!
7424: 
7425: Mephistopheles
7426: 
7427: Now we’re out of our wits again, already, at the point where men’s brains
7428: are cracked. Why did you enter into partnership with us, if you can’t go
7429: through with it? Would you take wing, and yet be free of dizziness? Did we
7430: thrust ourselves on you, or you on us?
7431: Faust
7432: 
7433: Don’t gnash your greedy jaws at me! It disgusts me! – Great and glorious
7434: Spirit, you who revealed yourself to me, nobly, who know my heart and
7435: soul, why shackle me to this disgraceful companion, who feeds on injury,
7436: and at the last on ruin?
7437: 
7438: Mephistopheles
7439: 
7440: Have you finished?
7441: 
7442: Faust
7443: 
7444: Save her, or woe to you! May the weightiest curse fall on you for a thousand
7445: ages!
7446: 
7447: Mephistopheles
7448: 
7449: I can’t undo the bonds of the Avenger, nor loose his bolts. – ‘Save her!’ –
7450: Who was it dragged her to ruin? I or you?
7451: 
7452: (Faust looks around, wildly.)
7453: 
7454: Would you grasp the lightning? A good thing it has not been allowed you
7455: miserable mortals! To crush the innocent one who replies is the tyrant’s way
7456: to free oneself of an embarrassment.
7457: 
7458: Faust
7459: 
7460: Take me to her! She shall be freed!
7461: 
7462: Mephistopheles
7463: 
7464: And the danger you expose yourself to? Be aware, the guilty blood from
7465: your hands lies on the town. Avenging spirits hover over the place of death,
7466: and lie in wait for the murderer’s return.
7467: Faust
7468: 
7469: And not from yours, too? Murder, and death in this world, be on you,
7470: monster! Take me there, I say, and free her.
7471: 
7472: Mephistopheles
7473: 
7474: I’ll take you: listen to what I can do! Have I all the powers of heaven and
7475: earth? I’ll confuse the jailor’s mind: you take possession of the key, and
7476: bring her out, hand in human hand! I’ll keep watch: magic horses are ready:
7477: I’ll carry you away. That, I can do.
7478: 
7479: Faust
7480: 
7481: Away!
7482: Part I Scene XXIV: Night
7483: 
7484: (An open field. Faust and Mephistopheles flying onwards on black horses.)
7485: 
7486: Faust
7487: 
7488: What do they weave, round the Ravenstone?
7489: 
7490: Mephistopheles
7491: 
7492: I don’t know what they’re cooking and brewing.                      4400
7493: 
7494: Faust
7495: 
7496: Soaring up, diving down, bending and bowing.
7497: 
7498: Mephistopheles
7499: 
7500: A guild of witches.
7501: 
7502: Faust
7503: 
7504: They scatter, they consecrate.
7505: 
7506: Mephistopheles
7507: 
7508: Away! Away!
7509: Part I Scene XXV: A Dungeon
7510: 
7511: (Faust, with a bunch of keys and a lamp, in front of an iron door.)
7512: 
7513: A long-forgotten shudder grips me,                                    4405
7514: I’m gripped by all of Mankind’s misery,
7515: Here behind these damp walls, she
7516: Lives: and all her guilt’s illusory.
7517: Do I tremble, then, to free her!
7518: Do I dread, once more, to see her!                                    4410
7519: On! Fear adds to death’s proximity.
7520: 
7521: (He grips the lock. She sings within.)
7522: 
7523: My mother, the whore
7524: She killed me!
7525: My father, the rogue,
7526: He gnawed me!                                                         4415
7527: Little sister alone
7528: Laid out the bone
7529: In the cool of the clay:
7530: Then I was a sweet bird on the stone.
7531: Fly away! Fly away!                                                   4420
7532: 
7533: Faust (Unlocking the door.)
7534: 
7535: She doesn’t know her lover’s listening,
7536: Hears the chains, the straw’s rustling.
7537: 
7538: (He enters.)
7539: 
7540: Margaret (Hiding herself in the bed of straw.)
7541: 
7542: Woe! Woe! It comes. Bitterest Death!
7543: 
7544: Faust (Whispering)
7545: 
7546: Hush! Hush! It’s I who come, to free you.
7547: Margaret (Throwing herself down in front of him.)
7548: 
7549: Are you a man? Then pity my distress.               4425
7550: 
7551: Faust
7552: 
7553: Your cries will wake the jailors, too!
7554: 
7555: (He grasps the chains, to loose them.)
7556: 
7557: Margaret (On her knees.)
7558: 
7559: Who gives the executioner
7560: Such power over me!
7561: At midnight you’re already here.
7562: Let me live, have mercy on me!                      4430
7563: Won’t it be soon enough when dawn should come?
7564: 
7565: (She stands up.)
7566: 
7567: I’m still so young, so young!
7568: And yet I’ll die!
7569: I was lovely too, that was my
7570: Ruin. My love was near, now he’s gone:              4435
7571: The garland’s torn: the flowers are done.
7572: Don’t grip me, now, so violently!
7573: What harm have I done you? Spare me!
7574: Don’t let me beg for mercy, in vain,
7575: I’ve never seen you before today!                   4440
7576: 
7577: Faust
7578: 
7579: How shall I endure this misery, say!
7580: 
7581: Margaret
7582: 
7583: I’m wholly in your power. Oh,
7584: Let me feed my baby first.
7585: I caressed it all night, though,
7586: They told me I caused it hurt,                      4445
7587: And now they say I killed it, so,
7588: And now I’ll never be happy again.
7589: They sing songs of me! It’s wicked of folk!
7590: There’s an old story ends this way,
7591: Who told them to tell it so?                     4450
7592: 
7593: Faust (Falling on his knees.)
7594: 
7595: A lover lies at your feet,
7596: Who’ll end your painful slavery.
7597: 
7598: Margaret (Throwing herself down next to him.)
7599: 
7600: O let’s kneel, the saints will bless!
7601: See here! Under these steps,
7602: Under this sill,                                 4455
7603: Seethes Hell!
7604: The Evil One
7605: With fierce anger,
7606: Makes his groan!
7607: 
7608: Faust (Aloud)
7609: 
7610: Gretchen! Gretchen!                              4460
7611: 
7612: Margaret (Listening closely.)
7613: 
7614: The voice of my lover!
7615: 
7616: (She leaps to her feet: the chains fall away.)
7617: 
7618: Where? I heard him call me.
7619: I’m free! No one holds me.
7620: To his neck, I shall fly,
7621: On his breast, I shall lie!                      4465
7622: He called Gretchen! Stood at the sill.
7623: Among the howls and cries of Hell,
7624: Among the devil’s, scornful groans,
7625: I knew his sweet, dear tones.
7626: Faust
7627: 
7628: I’m here!
7629: 
7630: Margaret
7631: 
7632:                       Here! O, say it once again!   4470
7633: 
7634: (She embraces him.)
7635: 
7636: It’s he! It’s he! Where now is all the pain?
7637: Where now the chains, the dungeon’s misery?
7638: You’re here! You come to save me.
7639: I am saved!
7640: Already the street is there again,                  4475
7641: Where I first saw you plain,
7642: And the joyful garden,
7643: Where Martha and I waited, then.
7644: 
7645: Faust (Struggling to move.)
7646: 
7647: Come with me! Come!
7648: 
7649: Margaret (Caressing him.)
7650: 
7651:                             O stay,
7652: I’ll gladly stay, if you are with me.               4480
7653: 
7654: Faust
7655: 
7656: Away!
7657: If you don’t hurry,
7658: We’ll pay for this.
7659: 
7660: Margaret
7661: 
7662: What? You can no longer kiss?
7663: My dear, so short a time to miss me,                4485
7664: And you’ve forgotten how to kiss me?
7665: Why am I so anxious on your breast?
7666: When, once, at your words, your gaze,
7667: With a whole heaven I was blessed,
7668: And you kissed me, enough to suffocate.   4490
7669: Kiss me!
7670: I kiss you: see!
7671: 
7672: (She embraces him.)
7673: 
7674: Oh! How cold and silent,
7675: Your lips.
7676: Where has your passion                    4495
7677: Gone?
7678: Who brought me this?
7679: 
7680: (She turns away from him.)
7681: 
7682: Faust
7683: 
7684: Come! Follow me! Darling, be bold!
7685: I’ll clasp you with a thousand-fold
7686: Warmth: now follow me! I beg you!         4500
7687: 
7688: Margaret (Turning to him.)
7689: 
7690: And is it you? Is it really you?
7691: 
7692: Faust
7693: 
7694: It is! Come, with me!
7695: 
7696: Margaret
7697: 
7698:            You’ll loose the chains,
7699: And take me to your breast, again.
7700: How is it you don’t shrink from me?
7701: Do you know, friend, whom you free?       4505
7702: Faust
7703: 
7704: Come! Come! The night will soon be over.
7705: 
7706: Margaret
7707: 
7708: I’ve killed my mother,
7709: I’ve drowned my child.
7710: Was it not given to you and I?
7711: You too. - You here! I scarce believe.     4510
7712: Give me your hand! This is no dream.
7713: Your dear hand! – Ah, but it’s damp!
7714: Wipe it clean! Why do I think,
7715: It has blood on.
7716: Ah God! What have you done?                4515
7717: Put your sword away,
7718: I beg you, please!
7719: 
7720: Faust
7721: 
7722: Let past be past I say!
7723: You’re destroying me!
7724: 
7725: Margaret
7726: 
7727: No you must live on: must do.              4520
7728: I’ll describe our graves to you.
7729: You must begin them
7730: This very dawn:
7731: The best one is for my mother,
7732: Then, by her, my brother,                  4525
7733: Myself, a little further, lay,
7734: But not too far away!
7735: And the little one, at my right breast.
7736: No one else by me will lie! –
7737: Ah, to nestle at your side,                4530
7738: That was a sweet, a darling bliss!
7739: But no more will I achieve it:
7740: It’s as if I must force you to it,
7741: As if you turn aside my kiss:
7742: And yet it’s you, so good, so sweet to see!    4535
7743: 
7744: Faust
7745: 
7746: You know it is, so come with me!
7747: 
7748: Margaret
7749: 
7750: Out there?
7751: 
7752: Faust
7753: 
7754: To Freedom.
7755: 
7756: Margaret
7757: 
7758:              If the grave is there,
7759: Death waiting, then I come!
7760: From here to everlasting rest,                 4540
7761: And not a step further would
7762: You go now? O Heinrich, if I could!
7763: 
7764: Faust
7765: 
7766: You can! Just will it! The door is open!
7767: 
7768: Margaret
7769: 
7770: I dare not: there’s no hope for me then.
7771: What use is flight? They lie in wait for me.   4545
7772: To be forced to beg is a bitter existence,
7773: And cursed too with an evil conscience!
7774: To wander among strangers, bitter,
7775: And even then I’d still be captured!
7776: 
7777: Faust
7778: 
7779: I’ll stay beside you.                          4550
7780: Margaret
7781: 
7782: Quickly! Quickly!
7783: Save my poor baby!
7784: Away! Down the ridge,
7785: Now, by the brook,
7786: Over the bridge,                            4555
7787: Into the wood,
7788: Left, where the plank is,
7789: There, in the pool.
7790: Seize it now: you!
7791: It’s trying to rise,                        4560
7792: It’s moving still!
7793: Save it! Save it!
7794: 
7795: Faust
7796: 
7797: Be sensible!
7798: Only one step, and then you’re free!
7799: 
7800: Margaret
7801: 
7802: If we were on the mountain, only!           4565
7803: There my mother sits, on a stone,
7804: And oh, the cold, it grips me!
7805: There my mother sits on a stone,
7806: And wags her head, so heavy.
7807: No sign, no nod, for me, I’m sure           4570
7808: Her sleep’s so long: she’ll wake no more.
7809: She slept, while we took our pleasure.
7810: That was such a time to treasure!
7811: 
7812: Faust
7813: 
7814: Here all’s useless, speech or prayer:
7815: I’ll take you from this place: I’ll dare.   4575
7816: 
7817: Margaret
7818: 
7819: Let me alone! No, no force!
7820: Don’t grip me so murderously, oh,
7821: I’ve done all else to please you so.
7822: 
7823: Faust
7824: 
7825: The day breaks! Dearest! Dearest!
7826: 
7827: Margaret
7828: 
7829: Day! Yes, it’s dawn! The last I’ll see:                     4580
7830: My wedding day, that was to be!
7831: Tell no one you’ve been with Gretchen. Ah, bright glance!
7832: It’s done with: all in vain!
7833: We two will meet again:                                     4585
7834: But not in the dance.
7835: The crowd gather, without speech.
7836: The streets, the square,
7837: Can’t hold them, there.
7838: The bell tolls, the wand breaks.                            4590
7839: Now, they seize and tie me!
7840: I’m dragged already to the block.
7841: The blade that quivers over me,
7842: Has quivered before over every neck.
7843: Silent the world, now, as the grave!                        4595
7844: 
7845: Faust
7846: 
7847: Oh, would that I’d never seen the light!
7848: 
7849: Mephistopheles (Appears outside.)
7850: 
7851: Away! Or you’ll be lost, tonight.
7852: Useless staying and praying! Chattering!
7853: The horses are shivering,
7854: The dawn breaks, clear.                                     4600
7855: Margaret
7856: 
7857: What rises in the doorway, here?
7858: Him! Him! Send him away!
7859: Why is he here in this holy place?
7860: He wants me!
7861: 
7862: Faust
7863: 
7864:                              You will live!
7865: 
7866: Margaret
7867: 
7868: God of Judgement! To you, myself I give!       4605
7869: 
7870: Mephistopheles (To Faust)
7871: 
7872: Come! Now! Or I leave you both to stew.
7873: 
7874: Margaret
7875: 
7876: Father, save me! I belong to you!
7877: Angels! In Holy Company,
7878: Draw round me: guard me!
7879: Heinrich! For you, I fear.                     4610
7880: 
7881: Mephistopheles
7882: 
7883: She is judged!
7884: 
7885: A Voice (From above.)
7886: 
7887:             She is saved!
7888: 
7889: Mephistopheles (To Faust.)
7890: 
7891:                                 To me, here!
7892: 
7893: (He vanishes, with Faust.)
7894: A Voice (From within, dying away.)
7895: 
7896: Heinrich! Heinrich!
7897: Part II Act I Scene I: A Pleasant Landscape
7898: 
7899: (Faust is lying on flowery turf, tired and restless, trying to sleep. A circle of
7900: tiny, graceful spirits hovers round him.)
7901: 
7902: Ariel (Chanting, accompanied by Aeolian Harps.)
7903: 
7904: When the springtime blossoms, falling,
7905: Shower down, and cover all things,
7906: When the fields with greener blessing                                      4615
7907: Dazzle all the world of earthlings,
7908: Little elves, but great in spirit,
7909: Haste to help, where help they can,
7910: And, be he holy, be he wicked,
7911: Pity they the luckless man.                                                4620
7912: 
7913: You, hovering in airy circles, round his head
7914: Show yourselves in proud elf-form, instead,
7915: Calm all the fierce resistance of his heart,
7916: Remove the bitter barbs of sharp remorse,
7917: Free him from past terrors, by your art.                                   4625
7918: Four are the watches night makes in its course,
7919: At once, now, mercifully, let the dark depart.
7920: Let his head sink down on pillow’s coolness,
7921: Next sprinkle him with dew from Lethe’s stream:
7922: Then let his joints be free of cramps and stiffness,                       4630
7923: So that he’s strong enough to greet day’s gleam:
7924: Elves exert your sweetest right,
7925: Return him to the holy light!
7926: 
7927: Choir (Singly, and two or more, alternately and together.)
7928: 
7929: When the balmy breezes smother
7930: All the green-encircled land,                                              4635
7931: Sweetly fragrant and mist-covered,
7932: Twilight gathers all around.
7933: Sweet peace then whispers softly,
7934: Rocks the heart on childhood’s shores,
7935: And on the eyelids, tired and weary,
7936: Closes daylight’s golden doors.
7937: Here the night’s already passing,
7938: Sacred stars set, star by star,
7939: Great lights, and the lesser glittering,
7940: Sparkling near, and gleaming far:           4645
7941: Sparkling, where the lake reflects her,
7942: Gleaming bright in cloudless height,
7943: Protecting the deep bliss of rest, there,
7944: Moon, in splendour, rules the night.
7945: 
7946: The hours have vanished now, already        4650
7947: Joy and pain have flown away,
7948: You are whole! Recover, wholly:
7949: Trust the sight of breaking day.
7950: Greening valleys, swelling hills there,
7951: Rise from out their shadowy sleep:          4655
7952: And, drifting in its waves of silver,
7953: On to harvest, flows the wheat.
7954: 
7955: Wish then, to achieve your wishes,
7956: Gaze up, at the brightness there!
7957: You are lightly tangled: this is            4660
7958: Sleep, a shell, so now emerge!
7959: Don’t delay, walk bravely, tall,
7960: When the crowd waits, hesitating:
7961: The noblest man achieves his all,
7962: By seeing, and then, swiftly, taking.       4665
7963: 
7964: 
7965: Ariel
7966: 
7967: Listen! Hear the hour nearing!
7968: Ringing out to spirit-hearing,
7969: Now, the new day is appearing.
7970: Doors of stone creak and chatter,
7971: Phoebus’ wheels roll and clatter,           4670
7972: What a din the daylight’s bringing!
7973: Trombone- and trumpeting,
7974: Eyes amazed, and ears ringing,
7975: The Unheard drops out of hearing.
7976: Slip into the flowers presence,                       4675
7977: Deeper, deeper, lie there silent,
7978: In the pebbles, where the leaves bend:
7979: If it strikes you, you’ll be deafened.
7980: 
7981: Faust
7982: 
7983: Life’s pulses beating now, with new existence,
7984: Greet the mild ethereal half-light round me:          4680
7985: You, Earth, stood firm tonight, as well: I sense
7986: Your breath is quickening all the things about me,
7987: Already, with that joy you give, beginning
7988: To stir the strengthening resolution in me,
7989: That strives, forever, towards highest Being. –       4685
7990: Now the world unfolds, in half-light’s gleam,
7991: The wood’s alive, its thousand harmonies singing,
7992: While through the valleys, misted ribbons stream:
7993: And heavenly light now penetrates the deep:
7994: Twigs, branches shoot, with fresher life it seems,    4690
7995: From fragrant gulfs, where they were sunk in sleep:
7996: Colour on colour lifts now from the ground,
7997: As leaf and flower with trembling dewdrops weep –
7998: And a paradise reveals itself, all round.
7999: Gaze upwards! – The vast mountain heights             4695
8000: Already with the solemn hour resound:
8001: They are the first to enjoy the eternal light
8002: That later, for us, will work its way below.
8003: Now, to the sloping Alpine meadows bright,
8004: It gives a fresh clarity, a newer glow,               4700
8005: And step by step it reaches us down here: –
8006: It blazes out! – Ah, already blinded, though
8007: I turn away, my eyesight wounded, pierced.
8008: So it is, when to the thing we yearn for
8009: The highest wish so intimately rehearsed,             4705
8010: We find fulfilment opening wide the door:
8011: And then, from eternal space, there breaks
8012: A flood of flame, we stand amazed before:
8013: We wished to set the torch of life ablaze,
8014: A sea of fire consumes us, and such fire!             4710
8015: Love, is it, then? Or hate? This fierce embrace,
8016: The joy and pain of alternating pyres,
8017: So that, gazing back to earth again,
8018: We seek to veil ourselves in youth’s desire.
8019: Let the sun shine on, behind me, then!               4715
8020: The waterfall that splits the cliffs’ broad edge,
8021: I gaze at with a growing pleasure, when
8022: A thousand torrents plunge from ledge to ledge,
8023: And still a thousand more pour down that stair,
8024: Spraying the bright foam skywards from their beds.   4720
8025: And in lone splendour, through the tumult there,
8026: The rainbow’s arch of colour, bending brightly,
8027: Is clearly marked, and then dissolved in air,
8028: Around it the cool showers, falling lightly.
8029: There the efforts of mankind they mirror.            4725
8030: Reflect on it, you’ll understand precisely:
8031: We live our life amongst refracted colour.
8032: Part II Act I Scene II: The Emperor’s Castle: The Throne Room
8033: 
8034: (A council of state waits for the Emperor. Trumpets.)
8035: 
8036: (Enter court attendants of all kinds, splendidly dressed. The Emperor
8037: approaches the throne: the Astrologer is to his right.)
8038: 
8039: The Emperor
8040: 
8041: I greet you all, the loved, and true,
8042: Gathered here from far and wide: -
8043: I see a wise man’s at my side,                                          4730
8044: But where on earth’s the fool?
8045: 
8046: Attendant
8047: 
8048: Right behind your mantle there,
8049: He suddenly tumbled on the stair,
8050: They dragged away the pile of fat.
8051: Dead: or drunk? No man knows that.                                      4735
8052: 
8053: A Second Attendant
8054: 
8055: At once, and at a wondrous pace,
8056: Another came to take his place.
8057: Quite extravagantly dressed,
8058: Yet troubling, since he’s so grotesque:
8059: Guards closed the door in his face,                                     4740
8060: Their halberds held crosswise too –
8061: Yet here he comes, the daring fool!
8062: 
8063: Mephistopheles (Kneeling in front of the throne.)
8064: 
8065: What is cursed, and yet is welcomed?
8066: What’s desired, yet chased away?
8067: What’s always carefully defended?                                       4745
8068: What’s abused: condemned, I say?
8069: What do you not dare appeal to?
8070: What will all, happily, hear named?
8071: What stands on the step before you?
8072: What’s banished from here, all the same?                 4750
8073: 
8074: The Emperor
8075: 
8076: For once, at least, spare us your babble!
8077: This is no time or place for riddles,
8078: They’re a matter for these gentlemen. –
8079: Solve it! I’ll gladly hear it all again.
8080: I fear my old fool’s wandered far in space:              4755
8081: Come to my side, here, and take his place.
8082: 
8083: (Mephistopheles places himself on the Emperor’s left.)
8084: 
8085: Murmurs From the Crowd
8086: 
8087: A newer fool – for newer cares –
8088: Where’s he from? – How’d he get there? –
8089: The old one fell – He’s all done in –
8090: He was fat – Now this one’s thin –                       4760
8091: The Emperor
8092: 
8093: So now, my faithful and beloved,
8094: Welcome here from near and far!
8095: We meet beneath a lucky star,
8096: Since health and luck are written above.
8097: But tell me, why in days like these,                     4765
8098: When we’ve conquered care,
8099: And carnival masks are all our wear,
8100: And delightful things are waiting,
8101: We trouble ourselves with debating?
8102: Yet since you say we have to do it,                      4770
8103: It’s settled then, and we’ll go to it.
8104: 
8105: The Chancellor
8106: 
8107: The highest virtue, like a sacred halo
8108: Circles the Emperor’s head: and so
8109: He alone may validly exercise it:
8110: Justice! – All men love and prize it,                    4775
8111: What all ask, yet wish they could do without,
8112: The people look to him to hand it out.
8113: But ah! What help can human wit deliver,
8114: Or kindly heart, or willing hand, if fever
8115: Rages wildly through the state, and evil          4780
8116: Itself is broodingly preparing evil?
8117: Look about, from this height’s extreme,
8118: Across the realm: it seems like some bad dream,
8119: Where one deformity acts on another,
8120: Where lawlessness by law is furthered,            4785
8121: And an age of crime is discovered.
8122: Here one steals cattle, there, a wife,
8123: Cross, cup and candlestick, from the altar,
8124: And boasts of it for many a year,
8125: His skin’s intact, and so’s his life.             4790
8126: Then they take their claims to court
8127: The judge, in pomp, on his high cushion,
8128: Meanwhile there grows a furious roar,
8129: From swelling tides of revolution.
8130: They insist it’s crime and disgrace,              4795
8131: With their accomplices beside them,
8132: And ‘Guilty!’ is the verdict in a case,
8133: Only where Innocence is its own defence.
8134: So all the world will slash and chop,
8135: Destroying just what suits themselves:            4800
8136: How then can that true sense develop
8137: That shows the morally acceptable?
8138: At last the well-intentioned man
8139: Yields to the bribe, the flatterer:
8140: And the judge who can’t convict, is hand          4805
8141: In hand with the criminal offender.
8142: I’ve painted in black, but I’d rather draw
8143: Its image in the deeper colour that I saw.
8144: 
8145: (Pause)
8146: 
8147: The conclusion’s inescapable:
8148: If all men suffer when all cause trouble,         4810
8149: Then His Majesty himself is harmed.
8150: The Commander in Chief
8151: 
8152: How riotous things are in this wild age!
8153: They all lash out, and are lashed, these days,
8154: And everyone is deaf to all command.
8155: The citizen behind his wall,                            4815
8156: The knight in his cliff-top tower,
8157: Have sworn to defy us all,
8158: And hold fast to their power.
8159: The impatient mercenaries
8160: Impetuously demand their pay,                           4820
8161: And if we owed them less, already
8162: They’d be off, and march away.
8163: If one forbids what all desire,
8164: He’s disturbed a hornet’s nest:
8165: The kingdom, they should keep entire,                   4825
8166: Is plundered, and distressed.
8167: They’d like to wreak a wild disorder,
8168: Half the world has been dissolved:
8169: There are still kings beyond our border,
8170: But none of them think they’re involved.                4830
8171: 
8172: The Treasurer
8173: 
8174: In allies, then, who’d put their trust!
8175: The subsidies they promised us,
8176: Like water pipes are all blocked up.
8177: And, Sire, in all your wide estate,
8178: Who’s benefited from the take?                   4835
8179: Wherever you go, there’s some new pup,
8180: Who declares his independence.
8181: We watch, while they carry on:
8182: We’ve given away our rights, and hence,
8183: No rights are left for us, not one.                     4840
8184: Our parties too, however called,
8185: Can’t be depended on today:
8186: They like to praise, and blame: it’s all
8187: Impartial both their love and hate.
8188: They’re resting: they take cover,
8189: The Ghibelline, and Guelph.                             4845
8190: Now, who’ll help his neighbour?
8191: Each man just helps himself.
8192: The golden doors are fastened tight,
8193: Men scrape and scratch and glean, all right,         4850
8194: But our coffers still are empty.
8195: 
8196: The Steward
8197: 
8198: What evils, too, I must endure!
8199: We try to save each day, I’m sure,
8200: But every day sees greater need:                     4855
8201: So, daily, some new torment’s mine.
8202: The cooks, alas, have all they want:
8203: Boar, pheasant, hare and venison,
8204: Ducks and peacocks, chickens, geese,
8205: Payment in kind, and guaranteed,
8206: They keep coming all the time,                       4860
8207: But in the end we’re short of wine.
8208: Though cask on cask once filled the cellar,
8209: The best of vintages, and names, there,
8210: These noble lords can drink forever,
8211: And haven’t left a single drop.                      4865
8212: The council too must have their fill,
8213: They grasp their tankards tight until,
8214: Under the table, they have to stop.
8215: Now I’ll count the cost, you’ll see,
8216: The moneylenders won’t spare me,                     4870
8217: The advances that they give gladly,
8218: Will eat the future years, on top.
8219: Pigs don’t have time to fatten: instead
8220: Men seize the pillows from your bed,
8221: Even the bread from your table’s gone.               4875
8222: 
8223: The Emperor (After reflection, to Mephistopheles.)
8224: 
8225: Fool, do you know anything else that’s wrong?
8226: Mephistopheles
8227: 
8228: Me? Nothing at all! I see splendour, as I must,
8229: Around me, of you and yours! – Lack trust,
8230: Where Majesty commands so, without question,
8231: Where ready force scatters the enemy faction?               4880
8232: Where strong wills, with wit to understand,
8233: Active and various, are all at hand?
8234: What, for some evil purpose, could combine,
8235: For darkness, then, where such stars shine?
8236: 
8237: Murmurs
8238: 
8239: Here’s a rogue – who understands –                          4885
8240: He’ll tell lies – as long as he can –
8241: I wonder too – what lies behind –
8242: And what’s in front? – A project of some kind –
8243: 
8244: Mephistopheles
8245: 
8246: In this world, what isn’t lacking, somewhere, though?
8247: Sometimes it’s this, or that: here what’s missing’s gold.   4890
8248: True you can’t just rake it up from the floor,
8249: But wisdom knows the mines where one gets more.
8250: In mountain veins, foundation walls,
8251: Coined and un-coined golden hoards,
8252: And ask me, now, who’ll bring it to the light:              4895
8253: One gifted with Mind’s power and Nature’s might.
8254: 
8255: The Chancellor
8256: 
8257: Mind and Nature – don’t speak to Christians so.
8258: That’s why men burn atheists, below,
8259: Such speech is dangerous, all right,
8260: Nature is sin, and Mind’s the devil,                        4900
8261: It harbours within it, Doubt, that evil,
8262: Their misshapen hermaphrodite.
8263: Not so with us! – In the Emperor’s land
8264: Two kinds of men are still at hand
8265: Worthy alone to defend the throne:                          4905
8266: The Saints are they, and the Knights:
8267: They enter life’s uncertain fights,
8268: Rewards of Church and State they own:
8269: Firm in their resistance, check
8270: The confused aims of everyman.                        4910
8271: No, Nature and Mind are heretics!
8272: Wizards! Ruining town and land.
8273: And you, with brazen impudence still
8274: Invoke them here in this high circle:
8275: You’re fostering the corrupted will,                  4915
8276: Fools are always hand in hand.
8277: 
8278: Mephistopheles
8279: 
8280: By this I recognise a most learned lord!
8281: What you can’t feel lies miles abroad,
8282: What you can’t grasp, you think, is done with too.
8283: What you don’t count on can’t be true,                4920
8284: What you can’t weigh won’t weigh, of old,
8285: What you don’t coin: that can’t be gold.
8286: 
8287: The Emperor
8288: 
8289: You won’t sort out our faults like that,
8290: Will Lenten sermons make men fat?
8291: I’m tired of the eternal ‘if and when’:               4925
8292: We’re short of gold, well fine, so fetch some then.
8293: 
8294: Mephistopheles
8295: 
8296: I’ll fetch what you wish, and I’ll fetch more:
8297: Easy it’s true, but then easy things weigh more:
8298: It’s there already, yet how we might achieve it,
8299: That’s the tricky thing, knowing how to seize it.     4930
8300: Just think how, in those times of consternation,
8301: When a human flood drowned land and nation,
8302: People were so terrified, everywhere,
8303: They hid their treasures, here and there.
8304: So it was when mighty Rome held sway,                 4935
8305: And so it goes on, yesterday and today.
8306: Still buried in the earth, why, there it is:
8307: The earth is the Emperor’s, so it’s his.
8308: 
8309: The Treasurer
8310: 
8311: For a Fool his aim’s not out of sight:
8312: It’s true, that’s an old Imperial right.                4940
8313: 
8314: The Chancellor
8315: 
8316: Satan lays out his gilded nets, for you,
8317: These things don’t square with what’s good and true.
8318: 
8319: The Steward
8320: 
8321: Only bring them to court: I’ll welcome the sight,
8322: And I’ll gladly accept the thing as not quite right.
8323: 
8324: The Commander in Chief
8325: 
8326: The Fool’s clever, to promise what each of us needs:    4945
8327: A soldier will never ask from whence it all proceeds.
8328: 
8329: Mephistopheles
8330: 
8331: If you think I’m cheating you, maybe,
8332: Why here’s the man: ask Astrology!
8333: He knows each circling hour and house:
8334: So ask him: how are the Heavens now?                    4950
8335: 
8336: Murmurs
8337: 
8338: Two rogues, there – already known –
8339: Fool and Dreamer – so near the throne –
8340: An idle song – an ancient rhyme –
8341: The Fool plays – the Wise Man speaks, in time –
8342: The Astrologer (Speaks, with Mephistopheles prompting him.)
8343: 
8344: The Sun, himself, he is of purest gold:                       4955
8345: Mercury, messenger, of riches told:
8346: Venus has bewitched you all, and she
8347: Looks on you, soon and late, quite lovingly:
8348: The chaste Moon’s mood holds fast:
8349: Mars won’t harm: his strength won’t last:                     4960
8350: And Jupiter remains the loveliest sight:
8351: While Saturn’s great, but far away and slight.
8352: His metal we don’t greatly venerate,
8353: Light of worth, though leaden in its weight.
8354: Yes! When Sun and Moon are conjoined fine,                    4965
8355: Silver and gold will make the whole world shine:
8356: The rest as well in turn are all achieved,
8357: Palaces, gardens proud, and rosy cheeks:
8358: All this he brings this highly knowledgeable man:
8359: He can deliver, too, what nobody else here can.               4970
8360: 
8361: The Emperor
8362: 
8363: The words they say, I hear them twice,
8364: And yet I’m not convinced they’re right.
8365: 
8366: Murmurs
8367: 
8368: What’s all that? - A joke gone flat –
8369: Horoscopy – And Chemistry –
8370: I’ve heard that vein – Hoped in vain –                        4975
8371: Come, quick – It’s still a trick –
8372: 
8373: Mephistopheles
8374: 
8375: They stand around: they’re all amazed,
8376: They don’t trust what can be found,
8377: One babbles about deadly nightshade,
8378: The other of some jet-black hound.                            4980
8379: What matter if one thinks I’m jesting,
8380: Or another calls it sorcery,
8381: If the soles of their feet are itching,
8382: If their firm step totters towards me.
8383: All can feel the secret working                4985
8384: Of Nature’s everlasting power,
8385: And from its deepest lurking,
8386: A living vein shall rise and flower.
8387: When every member twitches,
8388: When all looks strange to your eyes,           4990
8389: Make up your minds, be delvers,
8390: Here the players, there the prize!
8391: 
8392: Murmurs
8393: 
8394: It’s like a lead-weight on my feet –
8395: My arm’s swollen – but then, it’s gouty –
8396: There’s a tickle here in my big toe –          4995
8397: All the way down my back it goes –
8398: From these signs, I’d say we’re near
8399: A rich vein of treasure, here.
8400: 
8401: The Emperor
8402: 
8403: Quick then! Don’t slope off there!
8404: Let’s test your froth of lies,                 5000
8405: Show us, all, this rarest prize.
8406: I’ll lay down the sword and sceptre,
8407: With my own noble hands, as well,
8408: If you don’t lie, complete the work myself,
8409: And, if you lie, then send you down to Hell!   5005
8410: 
8411: Mephistopheles
8412: 
8413: I’ll find the way there anyway –
8414: Yet I really can’t exaggerate
8415: What’s lying round ownerless, everywhere.
8416: The farmer, ploughing the furrows, lays bare
8417: A crock of gold the clods unfold:              5010
8418: Seeks saltpetre from damp limy walls,
8419: And finds there golden rolls of gold,
8420: In his poor hands: frightened by all.
8421: What caverns exist to be blown open,
8422: Through what shafts and cuttings then,            5015
8423: Burrow those gold-divining men,
8424: Those neighbours of the Underworld!
8425: Secure in vast ancient cellars, find,
8426: Golden plates, bowls, cups for wine,
8427: In rows, and heaps where they were hurled:        5020
8428: Goblets fashioned out of rubies,
8429: And if they wants to try their uses,
8430: Beside them there’s the ancient fluid.
8431: Yet – I would trust the expert though –
8432: The wooden casks rotted long ago,                 5025
8433: The wine makes tartar, in the liquid.
8434: Not just gold, and jewels, fine
8435: But the essence then of noble wine
8436: Terror hides, and night, as stark.
8437: So quiz the wise untiringly:                      5030
8438: It’s trivial, by day, to see:
8439: Mystery: houses in the dark.
8440: 
8441: The Emperor
8442: 
8443: See to it then! What use is it out of sight?
8444: Whatever’s valuable must see the light.
8445: Who knows a rogue for certain but by day?         5035
8446: At night all cows are black, and cats are grey.
8447: The pots down there, full of golden weight –
8448: Drive your plough, and, ploughing, excavate.
8449: 
8450: Mephistopheles
8451: 
8452: Take hoe and spade: and dig yourself,
8453: Labouring will make you great,                    5040
8454: A herd of golden calves, you’ll help
8455: To rise from out their buried state.
8456: Then with delight, without delay,
8457: You can, yourself, your love array:
8458: Glittering colours, shining gems, will best       5045
8459: Enhance your majesty, and her loveliness.
8460: The Emperor
8461: 
8462: Quick then, quick! How slow it always is!
8463: 
8464: The Astrologer (Prompted by Mephistopheles.)
8465: 
8466: Sire, restrain your urgent passion, please.
8467: First let all your pleasant pastimes go:
8468: Distracted natures won’t achieve the goal.            5050
8469: First we must atone for them in quiet,
8470: Lower things are gained by the higher.
8471: Who wants the good, must first be good:
8472: Who wants delight, must calm the blood:
8473: Who longs for wine, treads ripened grapes:            5055
8474: Who hopes for miracles, strengthens then his faith.
8475: 
8476: The Emperor
8477: 
8478: So let the time be passed in merriment!
8479: Ash Wednesday will achieve our grave intent.
8480: And we can celebrate, wild Carnival,
8481: More riotously, meanwhile, after all.                 5060
8482: 
8483: (They exit to the sound of trumpets.)
8484: 
8485: Mephistopheles
8486: 
8487: How merit and luck are linked together
8488: These fools can’t see, no, not a one:
8489: If they’d the Philosopher’s Stone, as ever,
8490: There’d lack a philosopher for the stone.
8491: Part II Act I Scene III: A Spacious Hall with Adjoining Rooms
8492: 
8493: (Arranged and decorated for a Carnival Masque.)
8494: 
8495: Herald
8496: 
8497: In our German lands, fear no evil,                              5065
8498: Dance of Death or Fool, or Devil:
8499: There’s a cheerful feast, here: wait.
8500: Our Sire, on his Roman travels,
8501: Has, for his profit, and our revels,
8502: Crossed the highest Alpine levels,                              5070
8503: And gained himself a happier State.
8504: The Emperor kissed the holy slipper,
8505: First, won sovereign rights, and as,
8506: He was gifted with the crown, there,
8507: Accepted a fool’s cap, for us.                                  5075
8508: We’re all newly born, now:
8509: Every sophisticated man,
8510: Pulls it snug over ears and brow:
8511: He seems a poor fool, but he’ll vow
8512: To wear it wisely as he can.                                    5080
8513: I see they’re gathering already,
8514: Hesitant alone, or paired off intimately:
8515: Chorus on chorus pushing through.
8516: In, and out, quite undeterred:
8517: And end up where they were before, too.                         5085
8518: With its hundred thousand scenes of the absurd,
8519: The World itself is just one giant Fool.
8520: Flower Girls (Singing, accompanied by mandolins.)
8521: 
8522: Dressed to win your praises,
8523: We are here tonight,
8524: Young Florentine ladies,                                   5090
8525: At the German Court of light.
8526: 
8527: Many a bright flower we wear
8528: To adorn our tawny hair:
8529: Silken threads, silken gear,
8530: They play their own part here.                             5095
8531: 
8532: Then our position’s well deserved, oh,
8533: Worth your praise, without a doubt,
8534: Our shining-flowers, by hand we sew,
8535: So they bloom year in, year out.
8536: 
8537: All kinds of coloured snippets,                            5100
8538: Placed with perfect symmetry:
8539: You might mock us bit by bit, yes,
8540: But the whole attracts you see.
8541: 
8542: We are pretty things to look on,
8543: Flower Girls, and very smart:                       5105
8544: Then, the temperament of Woman
8545: Is so very close to Art.
8546: Herald
8547: 
8548: Let’s see those trays of flowers
8549: That you carry on your heads,
8550: That paint your arms with colours:   5110
8551: What each likes, let her select.
8552: Quick: in walks and branches
8553: What a garden we will share!
8554: They are fit to crowd around us,
8555: Flower sellers and their wares.      5115
8556: 
8557: The Flower Girls
8558: 
8559: Haggle in this cheerful place,
8560: But seek no market here!
8561: At a quick and witty pace,
8562: Let all know what you bear.
8563: 
8564: An Olive-Branch with Olives
8565: 
8566: I don’t envy flowery ones,           5120
8567: Every kind of strife I shun:
8568: It’s unnatural, to me:
8569: So I am the sign of nations,
8570: And I seal their obligations,
8571: Mark of peace in any field.          5125
8572: I hope I’m worth good luck today:
8573: Some lovely head I might array.
8574: 
8575: A Garland of Wheat-Ears (Golden)
8576: 
8577: Ceres gift, for you to wear,
8578: Charming, sweet, we were all sent:
8579: The most desired of uses, here       5130
8580: As your beautiful adornment.
8581: A Fancy Garland
8582: 
8583: Like a mallow, bright with colour,
8584: A marvellous flower grew from the moss!
8585: Never known before to Nature,
8586: Yet Fashion brought it us.                                           5135
8587: 
8588: A Fancy Bouquet
8589: 
8590: My name’s for you to know,
8591: Theophrastus couldn’t tell you though:
8592: Yet I hope, if not all do,
8593: Many of us will still please you,
8594: She, I’d like, most to possess us,                                   5140
8595: Who might twine us in her tresses:
8596: Or if she should so decide,
8597: Set beside her heart, I’d ride.
8598: 
8599: Rosebuds
8600: 
8601: Many-coloured fancies may
8602: Form the fashion of the day,                                         5145
8603: Strange and curious of shape,
8604: Such as Nature never made:
8605: Stalks of green and bells of gold,
8606: Show in tresses all untold! –
8607: Yet we – remain here, covered up:                                    5150
8608: Lucky those who first discover us.
8609: When the summer is proclaimed,
8610: Then the rosebuds are in flame,
8611: Who would do without such pleasures?
8612: Promises, and yielded treasures,                                     5155
8613: That, in the flowery kingdom, rule,
8614: Mind and heart and glances, too.
8615: 
8616: (The Flower Girls garland themselves, and show their wares, gracefully, in
8617: the green leafy arcades.)
8618: The Gardeners (Singing, accompanied by lutes.)
8619: 
8620: See the flowers quietly growing,
8621: On your brows, sweetly amuse you,
8622: And their fruit will not seduce you,                                   5160
8623: One may taste delight in knowing.
8624: 
8625: Sunburned faces offer up,
8626: Peaches, plums, and cherries, yet.
8627: Buy! Against the tongue and palate,
8628: The eye is the worst way to judge.                                     5165
8629: 
8630: Come, of all this ripest fruit,
8631: Eat with taste, and delight!
8632: Poems on roses might still suit,
8633: But on the apple man must bite.
8634: 
8635: So then let us join with their                                         5170
8636: Flowering youth itself,
8637: And we’ll dress our riper wares
8638: In our neighbour’s wealth.
8639: 
8640: Dressed in cheerful garlands, there,
8641: Along this jewelled leafy route,                                       5175
8642: All things can be found together,
8643: Buds and leaves, and flowers and fruit.
8644: 
8645: (Both choruses set out their goods on the flight of steps, with alternating
8646: song accompanied by the lutes and mandolins, and offer their wares to the
8647: spectators.)
8648: A Mother (With her daughter.)
8649: 
8650: Child, when you came to light,
8651: I dressed you in your little hat:
8652: Your face was so sweet and bright,                                    5180
8653: And your body was soft, at that.
8654: I thought you’d soon be a bride,
8655: To the wealthiest of men allied,
8656: I thought you’d find a match.
8657: 
8658: Ah! Now already many a year                                           5185
8659: Has flown by, uselessly,
8660: The motley crowd of suitors here,
8661: Pass you quickly by, I see:
8662: With him you danced a lively dance,
8663: Gave that other a knowing glance                                      5190
8664: With your elbow, sharply.
8665: 
8666: I’ve thought about the many feasts
8667: We went to, all in vain,
8668: Forfeits, and Hide and Seek,
8669: Couldn’t help, that’s plain:                                          5195
8670: Today the fools are out the trap,
8671: Darling, open then your lap,
8672: There’s someone you can gain.
8673: 
8674: (Other young and lovely girls join the Flower Girls, and they gossip
8675: together. Fishermen and bird-catchers with fishing rods, nests, limed twigs
8676: and other implements appear, and scatter themselves among the girls.
8677: Mutual attempts to win over, catch, escape and embrace, allow the most
8678: agreeable conversation.)
8679: 
8680: Wood-cutters (Entering, loudly and boisterously.)
8681: 
8682: Make way! Stand back!
8683: We must be free,                                                      5200
8684: We fell the trees,
8685: They crash, and smash:
8686: And when we pass,
8687: Expect a smack.
8688: To give us praise                         5205
8689: Consider this:
8690: If coarser ways,
8691: Weren’t in this land,
8692: How’d the finest,
8693: Have means to stand,                      5210
8694: Despite they’re jesting?
8695: So learn our meaning!
8696: For you’d be freezing,
8697: If we weren’t sweating.
8698: 
8699: Pulcinelli
8700: 
8701: You’re fools, a troop,                    5215
8702: That’s born to stoop.
8703: We’re the wise,
8704: We see through lies:
8705: And then our bags
8706: Our caps and rags,                        5220
8707: Are light to wear:
8708: And free from care,
8709: We’re always idle,
8710: Slippered, we sidle,
8711: Through market crowds,                    5225
8712: Slithering about,
8713: Standing to gaze,
8714: And croak, amazed:
8715: And at that sound,
8716: Through heaving mounds,                   5230
8717: Eel-like slipping,
8718: Lightly skipping,
8719: We romp together.
8720: Praise us ever,
8721: Or scold us so,                           5235
8722: We let both go.
8723: 
8724: The Parasitical (Fawning, and lustful.)
8725: 
8726: You brave woodsmen,
8727: And your next of kin,
8728: The charcoal-burners,
8729: You’re the men for us.                   5240
8730: Since all the stooping,
8731: The ready nodding,
8732: The winding phrase,
8733: That plays both ways,
8734: That warms or chills,                    5245
8735: Just as one feels,
8736: What profit is it then?
8737: The mighty fire
8738: From heaven or higher,                   5250
8739: Might come in vain
8740: Without logs again,
8741: And coal heaps there,
8742: To light the oven
8743: And make it glare.
8744: It roasts and steams,                    5255
8745: It boils and teems.
8746: The finger-picker,
8747: The plate-licker,
8748: He sniffs the fry,
8749: Suspects the fish:                       5260
8750: Rules, by and by,
8751: The patron’s dish.
8752: 
8753: A Drunk (Confused.)
8754: 
8755: Nothing seems bad to me today!
8756: I feel so frank, and free:
8757: New joys, and happy songs, I say.        5265
8758: I brought them both with me!
8759: So let’s drink! Drink, and drink!
8760: Drink up, you! Clink, and clink!
8761: You behind me, come around!
8762: Drink it up, and send it down.           5270
8763: 
8764: My wife was so outraged, she screamed,
8765: When I turned up, dressed so funny,
8766: However much I boasted, she
8767: Kept calling me a tailor’s dummy.
8768: So I drink! Drink, and drink!                                         5275
8769: Clink the tankards! Clink, and clink!
8770: Tailor’s dummy: swill it round!
8771: When it’s clinked, drink it down!
8772: 
8773: Don’t you say, I’ve lost my way:
8774: I’m here, where I’ve got it made.                                     5280
8775: If host and hostess won’t play,
8776: I’ll get credit from the maid.
8777: Always drinking! Drink, and drink!
8778: Lift, you others! Clink, and clink!
8779: Each to each! So it goes round!                                       5285
8780: Too soon, I know, it’s all gone down.
8781: 
8782: However I please myself, may I
8783: Have it happen at my command:
8784: Let me lie here, where I lie,
8785: If I can’t, any longer, stand.                                        5290
8786: 
8787: Chorus
8788: 
8789: Every pal, now: drink and drink!
8790: A toast again, a clink and clink!
8791: Hold tight now to bench and ground!
8792: Under the table, he’ll be found.
8793: 
8794: (The Herald announces sundry poets – Poets of Nature, and Court, and
8795: Minstrels, Sentimentalists and Enthusiasts. In this competitive crowd no one
8796: allows anyone else to start reciting. One slips by with a few words.)
8797: 
8798: A Satirical Poet
8799: 
8800: As a poet, do you know                                                5295
8801: What I’d most enjoy, here?
8802: If I dared to sing, or bellow
8803: What no one wants to hear.
8804: 
8805: (The Night and Church Poets excuse themselves having become engaged in
8806: a very interesting conversation with a newly-risen Vampire, from which a
8807: new school of poetry might derive. The Herald has to accept their excuses,
8808: and meanwhile calls on characters from Greek Mythology, who even in
8809: modern masks lose neither their character nor power to charm.)
8810: 
8811: (The Three Graces appear.)
8812: 
8813: Aglaia
8814: 
8815: Grace it is we bring, to living:
8816: So be graceful in your giving.                                    5300
8817: 
8818: Hegemone
8819: 
8820: Gracefully may you receive:
8821: Lovely is the wish achieved.
8822: 
8823: Euphrosyne
8824: 
8825: And in quieter hours, and places,
8826: Chiefly, in your thanks, be gracious.
8827: 
8828: (The Three Fates appear)
8829: 
8830: Atropos
8831: 
8832: I, the eldest, I, the spinning                                    5305
8833: Am lumbered with this time: I’ve
8834: Need of lots of pondering, thinking,
8835: To yield the tender threads of life.
8836: 
8837: So you may be soft and supple,
8838: I sift through the finest flax:                                   5310
8839: Drawn through clever fingers, double
8840: Fine, and even, smooth as wax.
8841: 
8842: If you wish all joy and dancing,
8843: Excessive now, in what you take,
8844: Think about those threads: their ending.                          5315
8845: Then, take care! The threads might break.
8846: Clotho
8847: 
8848: Know that in these latter days,
8849: I was trusted with the shears:
8850: Since our eldest sister’s ways,
8851: Failed to help men, it appears.         5320
8852: 
8853: She dragged all her useless spinning,
8854: Endlessly to air and light,
8855: While the hopes of wondrous winnings,
8856: Were clipped and buried out of sight.
8857: 
8858: I too made a host of errors:            5325
8859: Myself, in my younger years,
8860: But, to keep myself in check, there’s
8861: The case, in which I keep my shears.
8862: 
8863: And so, willingly restrained,
8864: I look kindly on this place,            5330
8865: In these hours, your freedom gained,
8866: Run on and on, at your wild pace.
8867: 
8868: Lachesis
8869: 
8870: I, the only one with sense,
8871: To twist the threads am left:
8872: My ways brook no nonsense,              5335
8873: I’ve never hurried yet.
8874: 
8875: Threads they come, threads I wind,
8876: Guiding each one on its track,
8877: Letting no thread wander blind,
8878: Twining each one in the pack.           5340
8879: 
8880: If I, once, forgot myself, my fears
8881: For the world would give me pause:
8882: Counting hours, measuring years,
8883: So the Weaver holds her course.
8884: Herald
8885: 
8886: You wouldn’t recognise the ones who come now,        5345
8887: However much you know of ancient troubles,
8888: To look at them, the cause of many evils,
8889: You’d call them welcome guests, and bow.
8890: 
8891: They’re the Furies: no one will believe me,
8892: Pretty, shapely, friendly, young in years:           5350
8893: But meet with them, you’ll quickly learn I fear,
8894: How serpent-like these doves are to hurt freely.
8895: 
8896: Though they’re malicious, in modernity,
8897: Where fools now boast about their sinful stories,
8898: They too have ceased to want the Angels’ glories:    5355
8899: Confess themselves the plague of land and city.
8900: 
8901: (The Furies approach.)
8902: 
8903: Alecto
8904: 
8905: What does that matter? You still believe in us:
8906: Then, we’re pretty, young, and fawning kittens:
8907: If one of you has a lover, with whom he’s smitten,
8908: We’ll tickle his ears at length, sweetly fuss,       5360
8909: 
8910: Till it would be safe to tell him, eye to eye,
8911: That she waves to him, and him, the same,
8912: She’s thick up top, a crooked back, and lame,
8913: And married, she’d be no good, by and by.
8914: 
8915: We know how to pester the bride-to-be as well:       5365
8916: Scarcely a week ago, her lover himself,
8917: Said nasty things to her about herself! –
8918: They’re reconciled, but something rankles still.
8919: Megaera
8920: 
8921: That’s a joke! Let them be married, any way,
8922: I’ll take it up, and know, whatever may befall,      5370
8923: Through wilfulness the sweetest joys will pall,
8924: Man’s changeable, and changeable the day.
8925: 
8926: And no one holds the desired one in his arms,
8927: Without longing, foolishly, for the more-desired,
8928: Leave’s his good fortune, with which he was fired:   5375
8929: Flies from the sun, and asks the frost for warmth.
8930: 
8931: I know how to give birth to those things: there,
8932: Is Asmodi, who is my faithful servant,
8933: To work true mischief at the proper moment,
8934: And send to ruin all Mankind, in pairs.              5380
8935: 
8936: Tisiphone
8937: 
8938: Instead of malice: poison and the knife
8939: I’m mixing, sharpening for that betrayer:
8940: Love another, and sooner now or later,
8941: Ruin itself will penetrate your life.
8942: 
8943: Gall and wormwood they must roam                     5385
8944: Through all those sweetest moments!
8945: No bargaining here, no bartering, come –
8946: The perpetrator must atone.
8947: 
8948: Let no one sing about forgiveness!
8949: I cry my cause to the cliffs again,                  5390
8950: Echo! Hear! Reply: Avenge!
8951: Let him who alters, cease existence.
8952: 
8953: The Herald
8954: 
8955: I’ll ask you please, to move aside,                  5395
8956: Since what comes next, is otherwise.
8957: You can see, here’s a mountain coming,
8958: Decked with princely coloured trappings,
8959: A tusked head, snaking trunk, there too,
8960: A mystery, but I’ll reveal the key to you.
8961: A delicate and dainty girl sits on its neck,
8962: And with a thin wand keeps the beast in check:      5400
8963: Another, up there, standing, wonderfully,
8964: Surrounded with light, almost blinding me.
8965: Beside it, two girls walk in chains, one fearful,
8966: While the other girl seems quite cheerful:
8967: One wishes to be, and one feels she is, free.       5405
8968: Let each of them declare who they might be.
8969: 
8970: Fear
8971: 
8972: Smoking torches, flares and lights,
8973: Are burning at the troubled feast:
8974: Among all these deceptive sights,
8975: Ah, I’m held fast by the feet.                      5410
8976: 
8977: Away, you ridiculous smilers!
8978: I suspect those grins so bright:
8979: All my enemies, beguilers,
8980: Press towards me through the night.
8981: 
8982: Here! A friend becomes a foe,                       5415
8983: Yet I know that mask, I’d say:
8984: One that wants to kill me, though,
8985: Now unmasked he creeps away.
8986: 
8987: Gladly, heedless of direction
8988: I’d escape from out this world:                     5420
8989: But, beyond, there roars destruction:
8990: In mists of terror I am furled.
8991: 
8992: Hope
8993: 
8994: I greet you, sisters! Though today,
8995: And the whole of yesterday,
8996: You enjoyed the masquerade,                         5425
8997: I know all will be displayed:
8998: In the morning you’ll unveil.
8999: And if, in the torchlight, we
9000: Don’t feel particular delight,
9001: Yet the days to come, so bright,              5430
9002: More wholly suited, we shall hail,
9003: Now as one, now solitary,
9004: Through fair fields, we’ll roam loose,
9005: To act, or rest, as we choose,
9006: And in that carefree way of living,           5435
9007: Dispense with nothing, go on striving:
9008: Guests are welcome everywhere,
9009: Confidently, let’s appear:
9010: Surely, the best anywhere,
9011: Must be somewhere, here.                      5440
9012: 
9013: Intelligence
9014: 
9015: Two of Man’s worst enemies,
9016: Fear and Hope, I bind for you,
9017: Now this country worries me.
9018: Make room! I’ll rescue you.
9019: 
9020: I lead the living Colossus,                   5445
9021: Turret-crowned, as you see,
9022: Step by step, he crosses,
9023: The highest passes, tirelessly.
9024: 
9025: But above me, on the summit,
9026: Is a goddess, there, who’s bearing            5450
9027: Outspread wings, and turns about,
9028: Everywhere, to see who’s winning.
9029: 
9030: Ringed by splendour, and by glory,
9031: Shining far, on every side:
9032: She calls herself – Victory,                  5455
9033: Goddess of the active life.
9034: 
9035: Zoilo-Thersites (An Ugly Dwarfish Warrior.)
9036: 
9037: Ah, ha! I’ve come just in time,
9038: I hold you all guilty of crime!
9039: Yet my goal I assume to be
9040: Her up there: Queen Victory.                  5460
9041: With her pair of snowy wings,
9042: She’s an eagle, she must think:
9043: And that whenever she’s on hand,
9044: To her belong the folk and land:
9045: But when famous deeds are done,               5465
9046: At once I’m here with armour on,
9047: When low is high, and high is low,
9048: Bent is straight, and straight not so,
9049: That alone fills me with mirth,
9050: I wish it so throughout the Earth.            5470
9051: 
9052: The Herald
9053: 
9054: So I’ll lend you, dog from birth,
9055: This good baton’s masterstroke!
9056: Twist and turn now: it’s no joke! –
9057: See how the twin dwarfish ape,
9058: Rolls into a foul lumpish shape!              5475
9059: A wonder – the lump’s an egg, on cue,
9060: It swells and then it cracks in two:
9061: Now a pair of twins appear,
9062: An adder and a bat roll clear.
9063: One through the dust is swiftly winding,      5480
9064: The black one’s flitting round the ceiling.
9065: They hurry outside, in company,
9066: I wouldn’t choose to be number three.
9067: 
9068: Murmurs
9069: 
9070: Lively now! There’s dancing there –
9071: No! I’d much rather be elsewhere –            5485
9072: Can’t you feel some ghostly race
9073: Fly about us, through this place? –
9074: Something just rushed through my hair –
9075: Round my feet, it’s flying, where? –
9076: None of us are injured though –               5490
9077: But we all are frightened so –
9078: All the fun is spoilt completely –
9079: As those creatures wished, you see.
9080: 
9081: The Herald
9082: 
9083: Since I play the herald’s role,
9084: As this masquerade unfolds,               5495
9085: I watch sternly at the door,
9086: In case some devious outlaw
9087: To this happy place, comes creeping:
9088: Never yielding, never wavering.
9089: Through the window, though, I fear        5500
9090: Airborne spectres enter here:
9091: From magic and from devilry
9092: Alas, I cannot set you free.
9093: All this makes the dwarf suspicious,
9094: Now! From behind, a new masque issues.    5505
9095: And I must dutifully explain
9096: The meaning of the forms, again.
9097: But I can’t easily announce
9098: What cannot be understood:
9099: Help me explain it, if you would! –       5510
9100: See it wander through the crowd?
9101: A splendid chariot, a four-in-hand,
9102: Rolling through them, where they stand:
9103: But it doesn’t split the people,
9104: I see no one’s crushed at all.            5515
9105: Colours glitter in the distance,
9106: Sundry wandering stars for instance,
9107: A magic-lantern-like performance.
9108: It blows along, a storm’s assault.
9109: Make way, there! I shudder!
9110: 
9111: The Boy Charioteer
9112:                             Halt!         5520
9113: Dragons, your wings restrain,
9114: Feel your accustomed rein,
9115: Control yourselves, if I control you,
9116: Sweep away when I inspire you –
9117: Let us do honour to this place!           5525
9118: Look round, a widening display
9119: Of admirers, circle now on circle.
9120: Herald, now, then! As you will,
9121: Before we leave you all,
9122: Describe us, and say our name:              5530
9123: Since we’re allegorical,
9124: You should know us, plain.
9125: 
9126: Herald
9127: 
9128: No, indeed, I can’t tell your name:
9129: I’ll try and describe you all the same.
9130: 
9131: The Boy Charioteer
9132: 
9133: So try!
9134: 
9135: The Herald
9136: 
9137:                            I must confess   5535
9138: To young and handsome, before the rest.
9139: You’re a half-grown boy: yet a woman
9140: Would prefer to see you fully grown.
9141: You seem to me a wooer, in future,
9142: Out of her house, a real seducer.           5540
9143: 
9144: The Boy Charioteer
9145: 
9146: Let’s hear more! Go on: go on,
9147: Find the riddle’s bright solution.
9148: 
9149: The Herald
9150: 
9151: Dark eyes that shine: night-black hair
9152: Which brightly jewelled bands enclose:
9153: And what a dainty garment flows             5545
9154: From shoulder down to ankle, there:
9155: With purple hem its glittering shows!
9156: One might take you for a girl:
9157: Yet for good or ill, you’d be,
9158: Prized already by any girl,                 5550
9159: She’d teach you your ABC.
9160: 
9161: The Boy Charioteer
9162: 
9163: And he, who like a splendid vision,
9164: Sits on the chariot, enthroned there?
9165: 
9166: The Herald
9167: 
9168: He seems a king, a rich and kind one,
9169: Blessed are they who gain his favour!       5555
9170: He has no further need to strive,
9171: His eyes observe whatever’s lacking,
9172: And to spread his pure delight,
9173: Is more to him than joy and owning.
9174: 
9175: The Boy Charioteer
9176: 
9177: You daren’t stop there: what you see,       5560
9178: You must describe it precisely.
9179: 
9180: The Herald
9181: 
9182: I can’t express all the dignity.
9183: But the glowing moon face, I see,
9184: The full mouth, the bright cheeks, then
9185: That shine beneath the jewelled turban:     5565
9186: Rich comfort in the clothes he’s wearing!
9187: What shall I say about his bearing?
9188: As a ruler he seems known to me.
9189: 
9190: The Boy Charioteer
9191: 
9192: Plutus the God of Riches, this is he!
9193: He’s come himself in all his splendour,     5570
9194: The Emperor wished greatly he were here.
9195: The Herald
9196: 
9197: Explain your own what and how to me!
9198: 
9199: The Boy Charioteer
9200: 
9201: I am Extravagance: I am Poetry:
9202: I am the Poet, who is self-perfected
9203: When his special gift is squandered.                     5575
9204: Yet I’m immeasurably wealthy,
9205: Like Plutus, worth as much as he,
9206: I adorn, enliven, dance and feast,
9207: And whatever he lacks, I complete.
9208: 
9209: Herald
9210: 
9211: Your boasting makes you handsomer,                       5580
9212: But let’s see all your skill appear.
9213: 
9214: The Boy Charioteer
9215: 
9216: Just watch me snap my fingers, now,
9217: The chariot will gleam and glow.
9218: There a string of pearls appear!
9219: 
9220: (He continues to snap his fingers, in all directions.)
9221: 
9222: Golden jewels for neck and ear:                          5585
9223: Flawless combs and diadems,
9224: Set in a ring, rare precious gems:
9225: I scatter flames too, here and there,
9226: Waiting for their chance to flare.
9227: 
9228: The Herald
9229: 
9230: How the dear crowd snatch, I see!                        5590
9231: The giver’s soon in difficulty.
9232: He snaps out jewels, as in a dream,
9233: And they all snatch them, in a stream.
9234: But now a different trick, you see:
9235: What each has grasped so eagerly,                     5595
9236: Has gained him but a poor reward,
9237: The gifts already fluttering skyward.
9238: The pearls are loosened from their band,
9239: And beetles crawl there in his hand,
9240: The poor man shakes them off, instead                 5600
9241: They’re humming now around his head.
9242: Another, for some solid thing,
9243: Catches at a butterfly’s wing.
9244: That’s what the rascal’s promise means:
9245: He only lends them golden gleams!                     5605
9246: 
9247: The Boy Charioteer
9248: 
9249: You know how to announce masks: it’s true,
9250: But it’s not the herald’s task to search below
9251: The outer surface of existence:
9252: That requires a keener sense.
9253: Still I’m wary of all disputes.                       5610
9254: Lord, I’ll direct my speech and questioning to you.
9255: 
9256: (Turning towards Plutus.)
9257: 
9258: Have you not trusted me with the task, to stand
9259: And guide the tempest of your four-in-hand?
9260: Don’t I steer well, as you direct?
9261: Am I not there, when you expect?                      5615
9262: And don’t I know how to win
9263: The palm, for you, on daring wing?
9264: When I’ve fought for you in war, now,
9265: I’ve been successful every time:
9266: When laurel wreaths adorn your brow                   5620
9267: Have I not fashioned them with hand and mind?
9268: 
9269: Plutus
9270: 
9271: If I’m required to be a witness to it,
9272: I’d say: You are the spirit of my spirit.
9273: You always act according to my wishes,
9274: And as I gain myself, you too are richer.             5625
9275: To reward your services, I value now
9276: The green branch higher than my crown.
9277: One true word, then, for everyone:
9278: I’ve found delight in you, dear Son.
9279: 
9280: The Boy Charioteer
9281: 
9282: The greatest gifts from my hand,             5630
9283: See! I’ve scattered them around.
9284: On every head there’s the glow
9285: Of some little flame I throw:
9286: Leaping from one brow to another,
9287: Halts on him, then leaves his brother,       5635
9288: But rarely does the flame-let rise,
9289: And briefly flower in bright skies:
9290: For many, before they know, it’s vanished,
9291: Sadly, it’s burnt out, and finished.
9292: 
9293: Women (Chatting to each other.)
9294: 
9295: Up there, on the four-in-hand,               5640
9296: He’s certainly a charlatan:
9297: And there’s a clown perched behind,
9298: By hunger and thirst he’s been refined,
9299: Like nothing one’s ever seen before:
9300: Pinch, and he’ll feel nothing at all.        5645
9301: 
9302: The Starveling
9303: 
9304: Disgusting women, leave me alone!
9305: Not to come here again, I’ll know.
9306: When women kept to their hearths, then
9307: Avaritia, Greed: was my name:
9308: The houses were fine, all about,             5650
9309: Lots came in, nothing went out!
9310: I took care of cupboard and chest:
9311: That was a burden, to top the rest.
9312: But now in this younger age,
9313: Wives don’t know how to save,                5655
9314: And like all those wicked students,
9315: They have more desires than ‘talents’,
9316: And their men have much to suffer,
9317: Their debts are left about all over.
9318: They spend whatever they can extract,       5660
9319: On their lovers, and on their backs:
9320: They eat of the best, and drink deeper,
9321: With their wretched army of admirers:
9322: Which adds to the value of gold, for me:
9323: We’re manly fellows, the Miserly!           5665
9324: 
9325: Leader of the Women
9326: 
9327: Let dragon be miserly with dragon:
9328: In the end it’s merely lies, illusion!
9329: Men flock around, and turn the charm on,
9330: But they’re soon annoyance and confusion.
9331: 
9332: The Crowd of Women
9333: 
9334: That Scarecrow! Give him a poke!            5670
9335: What’s the Wooden Rake threaten?
9336: We’ll all shun his ugly looks, then!
9337: Dragons of wood and paper: a joke!
9338: Look lively, now, and we’ll do him in!
9339: 
9340: The Herald
9341: 
9342: By my wand! Keep the peace! –               5675
9343: Though there’s no need for my assistance:
9344: Look at those grim monsters, how each
9345: Clears round itself a proper distance,
9346: Unfolding its quadruple wings, the beast.
9347: The dragons shake themselves, indignant,    5680
9348: With fiery throats, their tails rampant:
9349: The place is cleared: the people flee.
9350: 
9351: (Plutus descends from the chariot.)
9352: The Herald
9353: 
9354: He steps down, in a kingly manner!
9355: He beckons, and the dragons stir:
9356: From the chariot bearing Avarice,                  5685
9357: And gold, down comes the chest,
9358: See, there at his feet, it’s landed:
9359: It’s a wonder how it happened.
9360: 
9361: Plutus (To the Boy Charioteer)
9362: 
9363: Now you’ve left that troubling burden here,
9364: You’re free: so, fly now to your own sphere!       5690
9365: Not this! Where, confused, motley, wild,
9366: Distorted objects crowd around us, child.
9367: No: where you see clear, with sweetest Clarity,
9368: Self-possessed, trusting in your own self: flee,
9369: Where Goodness and Beauty may be viewed,           5695
9370: And there create your world – in Solitude!
9371: 
9372: The Boy Charioteer
9373: 
9374: So, I’ll be your worthy envoy then,
9375: So, I’ll love you like my dearest kin.
9376: Where you live, is Plenty: and where
9377: I am, all feel they gain in splendour.             5700
9378: And often hesitate in life’s uncertainty:
9379: Should they yield to you, or yield to me?
9380: Certainly your followers will have rest:
9381: Who follows me, with work’s forever blessed.
9382: My actions are never kept a secret,                5705
9383: I only have to breathe and I’m apparent.
9384: Farewell, then! You granted me my joy:
9385: But whisper low, and you shall have your boy!
9386: 
9387: (He exits as he came.)
9388: Plutus (Faust in disguise.)
9389: 
9390: And now it’s time to reveal the treasure!
9391: I strike the lock with the herald’s wand.            5710
9392: It’s open! Look! Vessels of noblest measure,
9393: Pour the golden blood through your hands,
9394: First it swells, roars, writhes as if it’s molten:
9395: A jewelled hoard of crowns, rings, and chains.
9396: 
9397: Various Shouts from the Crowd.
9398: 
9399: Look here, oh, there! How rich it flows:             5715
9400: The chest, right to the brim, it glows. –
9401: Golden vessels, molten too,
9402: Rolls of coins, turning too. –
9403: Minted ducats leaping,
9404: Oh, how my heart is beating –                        5720
9405: I see all, for which I’m yearning,
9406: On the floor there, burning! –
9407: It’s offered you, don’t be a fool,
9408: Be rich, you only need to stoop. –
9409: For, quick as lightning, all the rest,               5725
9410: Will take possession of the chest.
9411: 
9412: The Herald
9413: 
9414: What’s this, you Fools? Ah, yes,
9415: It’s no more than a maskers’ jest.
9416: Tonight, don’t ask for any more:
9417: Think you, we’d give you golden ore?                 5730
9418: In this game there are any amount
9419: Of pennies: too many for you to count.
9420: You clumsy idiots! A fine appearance,
9421: Seems, to you, truth’s naked essence.
9422: What is your Truth? – Hollow illusion                5735
9423: Grasps you, with its fool’s cap on. –
9424: Heroic Mask, Plutus that conceals,
9425: Drive these folk, then, from the field.
9426: Plutus
9427: 
9428: Your wand’s best by a mile,
9429: Lend it me for a little while. –              5740
9430: I’ll dip it, quick, in heat and glow. –
9431: You Maskers, all take care then, now!
9432: It gleams and bursts and throws off sparks!
9433: The wand already shines in the dark.
9434: And anyone who gets too near me,              5745
9435: Will be scorched, as well, mercilessly. –
9436: And now I’ll sweep with my brand.
9437: 
9438: Shouts and Confusion
9439: 
9440: Ah! We’re done for every man. –
9441: Fly, now, whoever can! –
9442: Back, back, the hindmost man! –               5750
9443: It’s shining brightly in my eyes. –
9444: On me the wand’s hot weight lies –
9445: We’re all lost, lost for good. –
9446: Back, back, you masks in flood!
9447: Back, back, you senseless mob! –              5755
9448: If I’d wings, I’d soar aloft. –
9449: 
9450: Plutus
9451: 
9452: The circle backwards sinks,
9453: Yet no one’s scorched, I think.
9454: The crowd will now give way,
9455: They’re only scared I’d say. –                5760
9456: But to guarantee good order,
9457: I’ll mark out an unseen border.
9458: 
9459: The Herald
9460: 
9461: You’ve done a fine job all right,
9462: Thanks to your cunning, and might.
9463: Plutus
9464: 
9465: Noble friend, you’ll still need patience:   5765
9466: All kinds of turmoil still threaten us.
9467: 
9468: Avarice
9469: 
9470: Now, if it pleases you, you may
9471: Cast your eye around with pleasure:
9472: The women are to the fore as ever,
9473: Where they can nibble things, or gaze.      5770
9474: Still, I’m not completely rusty!
9475: A lovely woman’s always lovely:
9476: And since, today, it costs me nothing,
9477: With confidence, I too go wooing.
9478: Still, here, in such a crowded space,       5775
9479: Lest words fall in an idle place,
9480: I’ll try being clever, attempt success,
9481: And in clear mime make my address.
9482: Hands, feet, gesturing won’t cut the ice,
9483: So, I’ll have to employ a comical device.   5780
9484: I’ll shape the gold like moistened clay,
9485: Since the metal’s malleable anyway.
9486: 
9487: The Herald
9488: 
9489: What’s he up to that skinny Fool!
9490: Is there a jest in the starveling too?
9491: He kneads the gold just like dough,         5785
9492: It’s soft between his hands, although
9493: However he squeezes and forms it all,
9494: It still remains a shapeless ball.
9495: He turns now towards the women,
9496: They all scream, and start to run,          5790
9497: Gesturing in complete disgust:
9498: That rascal’s up to no good.
9499: I fear he’ll be in ecstasy
9500: If he can offend morality.
9501: I shan’t remain silent, anyway              5795
9502: Give me the wand: I’ll drive him away.
9503: Plutus
9504: 
9505: He doesn’t see what we threaten here:
9506: Let him pursue his foolishness!
9507: There’ll be no room left for his excess:
9508: The law is great, but necessity’s greater.   5800
9509: 
9510: Tumult and Singing
9511: 
9512: The wild crowd come here, specially,
9513: From mountain-top, and wooded valley,
9514: Shouting forcefully, as they can:
9515: They celebrate the great god Pan.            5805
9516: They know what none can know,
9517: And into the empty circle flow.
9518: 
9519: Plutus
9520: 
9521: ‘I know you well, and your great Pan!
9522: Together these daring steps you plan.
9523: I know all that no one knows,
9524: And clear for you this narrow close.’        5810
9525: May good fortune follow them too!
9526: The strangest things may happen:
9527: They don’t know where they’re going to:
9528: Since they never look before them.
9529: 
9530: Wild Singing
9531: 
9532: You plaster people: you tinsel show!         5815
9533: Rough and coarse is how they go,
9534: Leaping: wild is their track ahead,
9535: Solid and sturdy is their tread.
9536: Fauns
9537: 
9538: The Faun flocks
9539: In happy dance,                          5820
9540: Oaken garlands,
9541: On curling locks,
9542: Fine pointed ears
9543: Through tangled hair,
9544: Snub noses, faces broad and flat,        5825
9545: The women can’t fault any of that:
9546: When the Fauns begin to prance,
9547: The loveliest won’t scorn the dance.
9548: 
9549: A Satyr
9550: 
9551: The Satyr’s leaping here behind,
9552: Goat’s foot, and lean of thigh,          5830
9553: Sinewy, skinny he’ll go by,
9554: And chamois-like, on mountain height,
9555: He looks around, and takes delight.
9556: He’s alive in the free air,
9557: Mocks at man, child, woman there,        5835
9558: Who deep in the valley’s damp flue,
9559: Think, cosily, they’re living too,
9560: While, still pure and undisturbed,
9561: To him alone is the upper world.
9562: 
9563: The Gnomes
9564: 
9565: The little crowd trips by there,         5840
9566: They don’t like to travel in pairs:
9567: In mossy clothes with lanterns bright,
9568: They pass together, quick and light,
9569: Each one passing on his own,
9570: Like glowing ants swarming home:         5845
9571: And always busy, here and there,
9572: Industrious, and everywhere.
9573: Kin to the ‘Little People’, known
9574: As surgeons to the rock and stone:
9575: ‘We bleed the mountains high,            5850
9576: We drain the deep veins dry:
9577: We hurl the metals round,
9578: With hearty greetings: Luck! Well found!
9579: And it’s always kindly meant: again,
9580: We’re the friends of all good men.                             5855
9581: Yet we the gold to light deliver,
9582: So men may steal, and covet ever,
9583: So princely hand won’t lack the steel
9584: That worldwide murder longs to deal.
9585: Who those three commandments breaks                            5860
9586: Scant heed of the other seven takes.
9587: But of all that we’re innocent:
9588: About it all, like us, be patient.’
9589: 
9590: The Giants
9591: 
9592: The wild men, we are named,
9593: Known in all the Hartz range:                                  5865
9594: Natural, plain, in all our antics,
9595: Appearing frightfully gigantic.
9596: A fir-tree trunk in each right hand,
9597: Round our body a thick band,
9598: A solid apron of branches, not                                 5870
9599: The bodyguard the Pope has got.
9600: 
9601: Nymphs in Chorus (Surrounding Great Pan, who is the masked Emperor.)
9602: 
9603: Here he’ll stand! –
9604: The world’s All,
9605: Is shown to all,
9606: In mighty Pan.                                                 5875
9607: You the happiest, surround him,
9608: In magic dances soar around him:
9609: Here now, serious and good, he
9610: Wishes all men to be happy.
9611: Under the curving roof of blue                                 5880
9612: He seems endlessly wakeful, too,
9613: Yet the streams flow gently for him,
9614: And the breezes gently rock him,
9615: And, when he sleeps at noon, the leaf
9616: Is motionless in the branches’ wreath:     5885
9617: The rich plants’ fragrant balsams there
9618: Fill all the still and silent air:
9619: The Nymph no longer dares to leap,
9620: And where she stands, falls fast asleep.
9621: But when his powerful shout,               5890
9622: Unexpectedly, rings out,
9623: Like thunder crack, or wave’s roar,
9624: Who knows what’s happening any more,
9625: The army’s witless in the fight,
9626: The hero in battle’s filled with fright.   5895
9627: So honour him, where honour’s due,
9628: And hail him, who led us to you!
9629: 
9630: A Deputation of Gnomes (To Great Pan.)
9631: 
9632: When the rich and shining goods,
9633: Spread threadlike through the deep,
9634: Then delicate divining rods,               5900
9635: Reveal what labyrinths keep.
9636: 
9637: Bending in our dark vaults, there,
9638: As troglodytes we’re measured,
9639: While in the purest daylight air,
9640: Gracious, you divide the treasure.         5905
9641: 
9642: Now we find we’ve discovered
9643: A marvellous fountain here,
9644: Promising, easily, to deliver
9645: Things that infrequently appear.
9646: 
9647: It all waits for your command:             5910
9648: Master, take and care for it: do.
9649: Every treasure in your hand,
9650: Helps the whole world too.
9651: Plutus (To the Herald.)
9652: 
9653: We must grasp things in the highest sense,
9654: And let what may come, come, with confidence.                      5915
9655: You’ve shown the highest courage once before.
9656: So now too what is fearful, we must try it:
9657: World, and posterity, will stubbornly deny it,
9658: So pen it faithfully in your report.
9659: 
9660: The Herald (Grasping the wand in Plutus’ hand, and assisting with the
9661: Masquerade.)
9662: 
9663: The dwarves lead on great Pan,                                     5920
9664: Gently, to the fiery fountain:
9665: It boils from the deep profound,
9666: Then sinks again, through the ground,
9667: And gloomy is its open round:
9668: Yet shows again the heat and glow.                                 5925
9669: Great Pan stands there, well disposed,
9670: Pleased with all this wondrous thing,
9671: Pearl foam, right, left, showering.
9672: How can he trust such a show?
9673: He bends to look inside, and so,                                   5930
9674: His beard gets caught within! –
9675: Who’s made that hairless chin?
9676: His hand hides it from our vision. –
9677: What follows is all clumsy action:
9678: The beard, on fire, flies back, soon                               5935
9679: Scorching garland, chest and head:
9680: Delight is turned to pain instead. –
9681: They rush to quench it all again,
9682: But none of them are free of flames,
9683: And how they flare and dart,                                       5940
9684: Exciting fire in every part:
9685: Wreathed in that element,
9686: The whole masked crowd is burnt.
9687: But what’s all this news about,
9688: Ear after ear, mouth after mouth!                                  5945
9689: O eternally unlucky night
9690: So little of it’s turned out right!
9691: Tomorrow’s dawn will declare
9692: What nobody wants to hear:
9693: In every ear we’ll hear it plain:             5950
9694: ‘The Emperor is in such pain.’
9695: O, would that it were something other!
9696: Burnt, Emperor and Court together.
9697: Cursed be those who led him astray,
9698: In resinous twigs did him array,              5955
9699: To rage, and bellow out that song,
9700: To the ruin of all that throng.
9701: O Youth, Youth will you never
9702: Restrict joy’s purest measure?
9703: O Power, Power, will you never,               5960
9704: Sense and Omnipotence treasure?
9705: The ‘forest’ too is soon in flames,
9706: The pointed tongues play their games,
9707: To the real wooden beams lick higher:
9708: We’re threatened by universal fire.           5965
9709: The cup of misery overflows,
9710: Who will save us? No one knows.
9711: See, Imperial splendour, by dawn’s light,
9712: Turned to a heap of ash, in a single night.
9713: 
9714: Plutus
9715: 
9716: That’s enough terror overhead,                5970
9717: Let help arrive here, instead! –
9718: Strike, you heavenly wand, with power,
9719: So the earth will ring and tremor!
9720: You, the wide realms of air,
9721: Fill with cool fragrance there!               5975
9722: Hurry down, to sweep around us,
9723: Cloudy mists and swelling vapours,
9724: Quench the thronging flames!
9725: Murmuring, trickling, fogs gather,
9726: Sliding, rolling, softly drenching,           5980
9727: Slipping everywhere, and quenching.
9728: You, the moist, who soothe forever,
9729: Change them all to gleaming weather,
9730: All these empty fiery games! –
9731: Threatening Spirits, that would harm,   5985
9732: We, by magic, will disarm.
9733: Part II Act I Scene IV: A Pleasure Garden in the Morning Sun
9734: 
9735: (The Emperor, his Court, Noblemen and Ladies: Faust and Mephistopheles
9736: dressed fashionably but not ostentatiously, both kneel.)
9737: 
9738: Faust
9739: 
9740: Sire, forgive the fiery conjuring tricks?
9741: 
9742: The Emperor (Beckoning to him to rise.)
9743: 
9744: More fun, in that vein, would be my wish. –
9745: At once, I saw myself in a glowing sphere,
9746: It seemed as if I were divine Pluto, there.                      5990
9747: A rocky depth of mine, and darkness, lay
9748: Glowing with flame: out of each vent played
9749: A thousand wild and whirling fires,
9750: And flickered in the vault together, higher,
9751: Licking upwards to the highest dome,                             5995
9752: That now seemed there, and now was gone.
9753: Through a far space wound with fiery pillars,
9754: I saw a long line of people approach us,
9755: Crowding till they formed a circle near,
9756: And paid me homage, as they do forever.                          6000
9757: From Court, I knew one face, and then another’s,
9758: I seemed the Prince of a thousand salamanders.
9759: 
9760: Mephistopheles
9761: 
9762: You are, Sire! Since every element
9763: Knows your Majesty, amongst all men.
9764: You’ve now proved the fire obedient:                             6005
9765: Leap in the sea, in its wildest torrent,
9766: You’ll barely touch its pearl-strewn bed,
9767: A noble dome will rise round you, instead:
9768: You’ll see green translucent waves swelling
9769: Purple edged, to make the loveliest dwelling,                    6010
9770: And you will be its centre. At each step
9771: Wherever you go, the palace follows yet,
9772: The very walls themselves delight in life,
9773: Flash to and fro, in swarming arrow-flight.
9774: Sea-wonders crowd around this sweet new sight,     6015
9775: Shoot past, still not allowed to enter quite.
9776: There, golden-scaled, bright sea-dragons play,
9777: The shark gapes wide, you smile in his face.
9778: However much your court attracts you now,
9779: You’ve never seen such an amazing crowd.           6020
9780: Nor will you part there from the loveliest:
9781: The Nereids will be gathering, curious,
9782: To this wondrous house, in seas eternally fresh,
9783: The youngest shy and pleasure-loving, like fish,
9784: The old ones: cunning. Thetis at the news,         6025
9785: Gives hand and lips to this second Peleus. –
9786: A seat there, on the height of Olympus, too…
9787: 
9788: The Emperor
9789: 
9790: I’ll leave the airy spaces all to you:
9791: Soon enough we’ll be climbing to that throne.
9792: 
9793: Mephistopheles
9794: 
9795: And, Sire, the Earth already is your own!          6030
9796: 
9797: The Emperor
9798: 
9799: What brought you here, now: what good fortune,
9800: Straight from the Thousand Nights and One?
9801: If you’re as fertile as Scheherezade
9802: I’ll guarantee you a sublime reward.
9803: Be ready then, when your world’s light,            6035
9804: As it often does, disappoints me quite.
9805: 
9806: The Steward (Entering hastily.)
9807: 
9808: Your Supreme Highness, I never thought
9809: To announce such luck, the finest wrought,
9810: As this is, for me the greatest blessing,
9811: Which I’ve revealed in your presence:              6040
9812: For debt after debt I’ve accounted,
9813: The usurer’s claws now are blunted,
9814: I’m free of Hell’s pain, and then,
9815: It can’t be any brighter in Heaven.
9816: 
9817: The Commander in Chief (Follows hastily.)
9818: 
9819: Something’s paid of what we owe,                  6045
9820: The Army’s all renewed their vow,
9821: The Cavalry’s fresh blood is up,
9822: And girls and landlords can sup.
9823: 
9824: The Emperor
9825: 
9826: Now your chests breathe easier!
9827: Now your furrowed brows are clear!                6050
9828: How quickly you hurried to the hall!
9829: 
9830: The Treasurer (Appearing.)
9831: 
9832: Ask them: it was they who did it all.
9833: 
9834: Faust
9835: 
9836: It’s right the Chancellor should read the page.
9837: 
9838: The Chancellor (Coming forward slowly.)
9839: 
9840: I’m happy enough to do so, in my old age. –
9841: See and hear the scroll, heavy with destiny,      6055
9842: That’s changed to happiness, our misery.
9843: ‘To whom it concerns, may you all know,
9844: This paper’s worth a thousand crowns, or so.
9845: As a secure pledge, it will underwrite,
9846: All buried treasure, our Emperor’s right.         6060
9847: Now, as soon as the treasure’s excavated,
9848: It’s taken care of, and well compensated.’
9849: The Emperor
9850: 
9851: I smell a fraud, a monstrous imposture!
9852: Who forged the Emperor’s signature?
9853: Have they gone unpunished for their crime?            6065
9854: 
9855: The Treasurer
9856: 
9857: Remember! You yourself it was that signed:
9858: Last night. You acted as great Pan,
9859: Here’s how the Chancellor’s speech began:
9860: ‘Grant yourself this great festive pleasure,
9861: The People’s Good: a few strokes of the feather.’     6070
9862: You wrote it here, and while night ruled the land,
9863: A thousand artists created another thousand,
9864: So all might benefit from your good deed,
9865: We stamped the whole series with your screed,
9866: Tens, Thirties, Fifties, Hundreds, all are done.      6075
9867: You can’t think how well the folk get on.
9868: See your city once half-dead with decay,
9869: Now all’s alive, enjoying its new day!
9870: Though your name’s long filled the world with glee,
9871: They’ve never gazed at it so happily.                 6080
9872: Now the alphabet’s superfluous,
9873: In these marks there’s bliss for all of us.
9874: 
9875: The Emperor
9876: 
9877: And my people value it as gold, you say?
9878: The Court and Army treat it as real pay?
9879: Then I must yield, though it’s wonderful to me.       6085
9880: 
9881: The Steward
9882: 
9883: It was impossible to catch the escapee:
9884: It flashed like lightning through the land:
9885: The moneychanger’s shops are jammed,
9886: Men pay, themselves, the papers mount
9887: They’re gold and silver, and at a discount.           6090
9888: Now used by landlords, butchers, bakers:
9889: Half the world think they’re merrymakers,
9890: The others, newly clothed, are on show.
9891: The drapers cut the cloth: the tailors sew.
9892: The toast is ‘Hail, the Emperor!’ in the bars,    6095
9893: With cooking, roasting, tinkling of jars.
9894: 
9895: Mephistopheles
9896: 
9897: Strolling, lonely, on the terrace,
9898: You see a beauty, smartly dressed,
9899: One eye hidden by her peacock fan,
9900: She smiles sweetly, looks at your hand:           6100
9901: And, quicker than wit or eloquence,
9902: Love’s sweetest favour’s arranged at once.
9903: You’re not plagued with pouch or wallet,
9904: A note beneath the heart, install it,
9905: Paired with love-letters, conveniently.           6105
9906: The priest carries his in a breviary,
9907: And wouldn’t the soldier be quicker on his way,
9908: With a lighter belt around his middle, say.
9909: Your Majesty will forgive me if, in miniature,
9910: I produce a low note, in our high adventure.      6110
9911: 
9912: Faust
9913: 
9914: The wealth of treasure that solidifies,
9915: That in your land, in deep earth lies,
9916: Is all unused. In our boldest thought,
9917: Such riches are only feebly caught:
9918: Imagination, in its highest flight,               6115
9919: Strives to, but can’t reach that height.
9920: But grasping Spirits, worthy to look deeply,
9921: Trust in things without limit, limitlessly.
9922: 
9923: Mephistopheles
9924: 
9925: Such paper’s convenient, for rather than a lot
9926: Of gold and silver, you know what you’ve got.     6120
9927: You’ve no need of bartering and exchanging,
9928: Just drown your needs in wine and love-making.
9929: If you lack coin, there’s moneychangers’ mile,
9930: And if it fails, you dig the ground a while.
9931: Cups and chains are auctioned: well,              6125
9932: Since the paper, in this way, pays for itself,
9933: It shames the doubters, and their acid wit,
9934: People want nothing else, they’re used to it.
9935: So now in all of your Imperial land
9936: You’ve gems, gold, paper enough to hand.          6130
9937: 
9938: The Emperor
9939: 
9940: The Empire thanks you deeply for this bliss:
9941: We want the reward to match your service.
9942: We entrust you with the riches underground,
9943: You are the best custodians to be found.
9944: You know the furthest well-concealed hoard,       6135
9945: And when men dig, it’s you must give the word.
9946: You masters of our treasure, then, unite,
9947: Accept your roles with honour and delight:
9948: They make the Underworld, and the Upper,
9949: Happy in their agreement, fit together.           6140
9950: 
9951: The Treasurer
9952: 
9953: No dispute will divide us in the future:
9954: I’m happy to have a wizard for a partner.
9955: 
9956: (He exits with Faust.)
9957: 
9958: The Emperor
9959: 
9960: Now, presents for the court: everyone
9961: Confess to me whatever it is you want.
9962: 
9963: A Page (Accepting his present.)
9964: 
9965: I’ll live well, happy, have the best of things.   6145
9966: Another (Also.)
9967: 
9968: I’ll quickly buy my lover chains and rings.
9969: 
9970: A Chamberlain
9971: 
9972: I’ll drink wines that are twice as fine.
9973: 
9974: A Second Chamberlain
9975: 
9976: The dice in my pockets itch I find.
9977: 
9978: A Knight (Thoughtfully.)
9979: 
9980: My lands and castle will be free of debt.
9981: 
9982: A Second Knight
9983: 
9984: It’s treasure: a second treasure I will get.        6150
9985: 
9986: The Emperor
9987: 
9988: I hoped for desire and courage for new deeds:
9989: But whoever knows you, thinks you slight indeed.
9990: I see, clearly: despite this treasure and more,
9991: You’re all the same, still, as you were before.
9992: 
9993: The Fool (Recovered, and approaching the throne.)
9994: 
9995: You’re handing presents out: give me one too!       6155
9996: 
9997: The Emperor
9998: 
9999: Alive again? You’d drink it all you fool.
10000: 
10001: The Fool
10002: 
10003: Magic papers! I don’t understand them, truly.
10004: The Emperor
10005: 
10006: That I’d believe: you’ll only use them badly.
10007: 
10008: The Fool
10009: 
10010: Others are falling: I don’t know what to do.
10011: 
10012: The Emperor
10013: 
10014: Just pick them up: those are all yours too.         6160
10015: 
10016: (The Emperor exits.)
10017: 
10018: The Fool
10019: 
10020: Five thousand crowns I’m holding, in my hand!
10021: 
10022: Mephistopheles
10023: 
10024: You two-legged wineskin, so you still stand?
10025: 
10026: The Fool
10027: 
10028: I’ve had my luck, but this is the best yet.
10029: 
10030: Mephistopheles
10031: 
10032: You’re so delighted: look, it’s made you sweat.
10033: 
10034: The Fool
10035: 
10036: But see here, is it truly worth real gold?          6165
10037: 
10038: Mephistopheles
10039: 
10040: You’ve there just what belly and throat are owed.
10041: The Fool
10042: 
10043: And can I buy a cottage, cow and field?
10044: 
10045: Mephistopheles
10046: 
10047: Why yes! There’s nothing to it: make a bid.
10048: 
10049: The Fool
10050: 
10051: A castle: with forests, hunting, fishing?
10052: 
10053: Mephistopheles
10054: 
10055:                                     Trust me!
10056: To see you a proper Lord would make me happy!      6170
10057: 
10058: The Fool
10059: 
10060: Tonight I’ll plant my weight on what I’ll get! –
10061: 
10062: (He Exits.)
10063: 
10064: Mephistopheles
10065: 
10066: Who doubts now that our Fool’s full of wit!

10069: (Faust. Mephistopheles.)
10070: 
10071: Mephistopheles
10072: 
10073: Why bring me here to this dark passage?
10074: Isn’t there fun enough inside,
10075: In the Court’s colourful tide,                6175
10076: Opportunities for jests and sharp practice?
10077: 
10078: Faust
10079: 
10080: Don’t give me that: in the good old days
10081: You wore us out in a thousand ways:
10082: And now this wandering, there and here,
10083: Is only so I can’t catch your ear.            6180
10084: But there’s something I need done:
10085: Commander and Chamberlain egg me on.
10086: The Emperor, I must work quickly for him,
10087: Wants Helen and Paris to appear before him:
10088: He wants to see the ideal form of Man         6185
10089: Clearly revealed to him, and Woman.
10090: Get to work! I daren’t break my word.
10091: 
10092: Mephistopheles
10093: 
10094: Such a thoughtless promise was absurd.
10095: 
10096: Faust
10097: 
10098: Friend, you haven’t considered
10099: Where your powers have lead us:               6190
10100: First we made him rich, and how,
10101: So he wants us to amuse him now.
10102: 
10103: Mephistopheles
10104: 
10105: You think it’s fixed that quickly:
10106: We’re looking at a deeper track,
10107: To the strangest realm, and wickedly,              6195
10108: Adding new faults to the old,
10109: Do you think it’s easy to call Helen back,
10110: Like a pasteboard spirit edged with gold –
10111: Witch-bitches, ghost-hostesses, freely,
10112: Or dwarf-maidens, I’ll serve you equally:          6200
10113: But Devil’s sweethearts, though you’re for them,
10114: Still you can’t, as heroines, applaud them.
10115: 
10116: Faust
10117: 
10118: Still the same old story, every day!
10119: With you, things are always difficult.
10120: You’re the father of all obstacles,                6205
10121: For every miracle you want more pay.
10122: I know: a little muttering, and it’s done:
10123: At a blink, you’ll bring her here.
10124: 
10125: Mephistopheles
10126: 
10127: With Pagan folk I don’t get on:
10128: They live in their own Hell there:                 6210
10129: Yet, there is a way.
10130: 
10131: Faust
10132: 
10133:                            Tell, without delay!
10134: 
10135: Mephistopheles
10136: 
10137: Unwillingly! There’s a greater mystery, I say,
10138: Goddesses, enthroned on high, and solitary.
10139: No space round them, not even time: only
10140: To speak of them embarrasses me.                   6215
10141: They are The Mothers!
10142: 
10143: Faust (Terrified.)
10144: 
10145:                            Mothers!
10146: Mephistopheles
10147:                             Are you afraid?
10148: 
10149: Faust
10150: 
10151: The Mothers! Mothers! It sounds so strange!
10152: 
10153: Mephistopheles
10154: 
10155: As, it is. Goddesses, unknown, as you see,
10156: To you Mortals, not named by us willingly.
10157: You must dig in the Depths to reach them:          6220
10158: It’s your own fault that we need them.
10159: 
10160: Faust
10161: 
10162: Where is the path?
10163: 
10164: Mephistopheles
10165:                  No path! Into the un-enterable,
10166: Never to be entered: One path to the un-askable,
10167: Never to be asked. Are you ready?
10168: No locks, no bolts to manipulate,                  6225
10169: You’ll drift about in solitary space.
10170: Can you conceive the waste and solitary?
10171: 
10172: Faust
10173: 
10174: I think you might spare the speeches then:
10175: They always smell of the witches’ kitchen,
10176: Of a long forgotten time, to me.                   6230
10177: Have I not trafficked with the world?
10178: Learned the void, the void unfurled? –
10179: When I spoke with reason, as I descried,
10180: Contradiction, doubly loud, replied:
10181: Have I not fled, from hateful trickery,            6235
10182: Into the wild, into the solitary,
10183: And, not to lose all, and live alone,
10184: Surrendered to the Devil’s own?
10185: Mephistopheles
10186: 
10187: And if you’d swum through every ocean,
10188: And seen the boundless space all round                 6240
10189: You’d still have seen wave on wave in motion,
10190: Though you might have been afraid to drown.
10191: You’d have seen something. Seen, within
10192: The green still seas, the leaping dolphin:
10193: Seen clouds go by, Sun, Moon and star –                6245
10194: You’ll see none in the endless void, afar,
10195: Hear not a single footstep fall,
10196: Find no firm place to rest at all.
10197: 
10198: Faust
10199: 
10200: You speak as chief of all Mystagogues, who
10201: Deceive their neophytes, the loyal and true:           6250
10202: Only reversed. You send me to the Void,
10203: So I’ll increase the power and skill employed:
10204: To use me, like a cat, that’s your desire:
10205: Just to claw your chestnuts from the fire.
10206: The same as ever! I’ll find what I’ll discover:        6255
10207: In your Nothingness, I hope, the All I will recover.
10208: 
10209: Mephistopheles
10210: 
10211: I’ll praise you, before you separate from me,
10212: That you know the Devil, I can truly see:
10213: Here take this key.
10214: 
10215: Faust
10216:                             That tiny thing!
10217: 
10218: Mephistopheles
10219: 
10220: Grasp it, it has a worth you’re undervaluing.          6260
10221: Faust
10222: 
10223: It’s growing in my hand, it shines and glows!
10224: 
10225: Mephistopheles
10226: 
10227: What one possesses in it, would you now know?
10228: The key will sniff the place out, from all others.
10229: Follow it down: it leads you to the Mothers.
10230: 
10231: Faust
10232: 
10233: The Mothers! That always strikes me like a blow!      6265
10234: What is that word that, once heard, scares me so?
10235: 
10236: Mephistopheles
10237: 
10238: Are you so limited one new word disturbs you?
10239: Will you only hear what you’re accustomed to?
10240: Don’t be troubled, whatever strange sound rings,
10241: You’ve already long been used to marvellous things.   6270
10242: 
10243: Faust
10244: 
10245: Yes, there’s no good for me in lethargy.
10246: A shudder’s the truest sign of humanity:
10247: Though the world is such we may not feel it,
10248: Once seized by it, we feel Immensity deeply.
10249: 
10250: Mephistopheles
10251: 
10252: Then, descend! I might as easily say rise!            6275
10253: It’s all the same. Escape from what exists,
10254: Into the boundless realm where all Form lies!
10255: Delight in what’s no longer on the list:
10256: Where turmoil rolls along all cloudily:
10257: Then, far from your body, swing the key!              6280
10258: Faust (Inspired.)
10259: 
10260: Good! I feel new strength, firmly grasped,
10261: My heart expands, on now to the great task.
10262: 
10263: Mephistopheles
10264: 
10265: Sight of a glowing tripod will tell you, finally,
10266: You’re in the last deep, deepest there might be.
10267: By its light you’ll see the Mothers,                    6285
10268: Some sit about, as they wish, the others,
10269: Stand and move. Formation, Transformation,
10270: Eternal minds in eternal recreation.
10271: Images of all creatures float, portrayed:
10272: They’ll not see you: they only see a shade.             6290
10273: Be of good heart, the danger there is great,
10274: Go to the tripod: don’t hesitate,
10275: And touch it with the key!
10276: 
10277: (Faust assumes a commanding attitude with the key.)
10278: 
10279: Mephistopheles (Watching him.)
10280: 
10281:                                         That’s right!
10282: It will close itself, and follow as a servant might:
10283: Exalted by your good luck, you’ll calmly rise,          6295
10284: And be back with it, before you’ve blinked your eyes.
10285: And, once you’ve brought it here all right,
10286: Call the Hero and Heroine from the night,
10287: The first man who has ever achieved it:
10288: It’s done, and you’re the one who did it.               6300
10289: By magic process then you’ll surely find,
10290: The incense’ vapour will become divine.
10291: 
10292: Faust
10293: 
10294: And now: what?
10295: Mephistopheles
10296: 
10297:       Strain with all your being: downward.
10298: Stamp to descend, stamp again to go upward.
10299: 
10300: (Faust stamps and sinks out of sight.)
10301: 
10302: If he might only gain some good from that key!   6305
10303: I’m curious as to whether he’ll return to me.

10307: 
10308: The Chamberlain (To Mephistopheles)
10309: 
10310: You still owe us that scene with the Spirits:
10311: The Emperor’s impatient. Get on with it!
10312: 
10313: The Steward
10314: 
10315: That’s what His Grace just now was saying:
10316: You! Don’t offend His Majesty by delaying.        6310
10317: 
10318: Mephistopheles
10319: 
10320: That’s why my companion has just gone:
10321: He knows how to put the whole thing on,
10322: And has to labour away in silence: still,
10323: All the most special diligence he applies:
10324: He who’d own that treasure, the Beautiful,        6315
10325: Needs highest arts, the magic of the wise.
10326: 
10327: The Steward
10328: 
10329: The arts you need are neither here nor there:
10330: The Emperor orders it to be prepared.
10331: 
10332: A Blonde Lady (Approaching Mephistopheles.)
10333: 
10334: Sir, a word! You see a clear complexion,
10335: Yet it’s not so in summertime’s dejection!        6320
10336: A hundred red-brown freckles all sprout there,
10337: And cover my white skin: I’m in despair.
10338: A cure!
10339: Mephistopheles
10340: 
10341:      A pity! Such a shining beauty,
10342: Spotted like a panther-cub, in May!
10343: Take frogspawn, toads’ tongues, in cohabitation,     6325
10344: Skilfully, under a full moon, make a distillation,
10345: When it wanes, apply it undiluted,
10346: When spring comes, the spots have been uprooted.
10347: 
10348: A Dark-haired Lady
10349: 
10350: The crowd are pressing round to squeeze you dry.
10351: I ask a cure! For a frozen foot                      6330
10352: That hinders me in dancing, walking by,
10353: And I curtsey awkwardly to boot.
10354: 
10355: Mephistopheles
10356: 
10357: Permit a little kick from my foot.
10358: 
10359: The Dark-haired Lady
10360: 
10361: Well, between lovers that’s occurred before.
10362: 
10363: Mephistopheles
10364: 
10365: Child! My kick means something more.                 6335
10366: Like cures like, when one’s suffering:
10367: Foot heals foot, and so with every member.
10368: Come! Pay attention! No retaliation there.
10369: 
10370: The Dark-haired Lady (Crying out.)
10371: 
10372: Ouch! Ouch! That hurt! I call that kicking
10373: Like a horse’s hoof.
10374: Mephistopheles
10375: 
10376:                 With that the cure I bring.       6340
10377: You can indulge in any amount of dancing,
10378: Touch feet under the table with your darling.
10379: 
10380: A Lady (Pushing forward.)
10381: 
10382: Let me through! My suffering is so great,
10383: He used to hold me in his heart’s embrace:
10384: Yesterday his joy was in my glances,              6345
10385: He turns his back on me: with her romances.
10386: 
10387: Mephistopheles
10388: 
10389: That’s serious, but listen to me now.
10390: You must gently press your advances,
10391: Take this charcoal: mark him anyhow,
10392: On his cloak or on his sleeve alight,             6350
10393: He’ll feel sweet Remorse’s blow.
10394: Swallow the charcoal straight away,
10395: No wine or water on your lips all day:
10396: He’ll be sighing at your door tonight.
10397: 
10398: The Lady
10399: 
10400: It’s not poisonous?
10401: 
10402: Mephistopheles (Offended.)
10403: 
10404:                 Respect now, where it’s due!      6355
10405: You’d have to travel far to find such charcoal:
10406: It comes from the dying pyre at a funeral,
10407: On which I, once more, diligently blew.
10408: 
10409: A Page
10410: 
10411: I’m in love: they say I’m not old enough to.
10412: Mephistopheles (Aside.)
10413: 
10414: I’m not sure now, whom I should listen to.            6360
10415: 
10416: (To the Page.)
10417: 
10418: Don’t set your heart on the younger ones.
10419: The older will value what they’ve won.
10420: 
10421: (Others crowd round.)
10422: 
10423: More, already! What a demanding crew!
10424: I’ll help myself, and out now with the truth:
10425: The worst expedient! The pain is great, you see. –    6365
10426: O Mothers, Mothers! Just let Faust go free!
10427: 
10428: (Gazing round him.)
10429: 
10430: The lights burn dim, already, in the hall,
10431: The Court’s moving off, and they’re all
10432: Arranged in their proper rank, I see,
10433: Through the far aisles and galleries.                 6370
10434: Now they assemble in the largest place,
10435: The vast Hall of the Knights, there’s barely space,
10436: Who bought the mass of bright tapestry,
10437: Filled corners, niches like an armoury.
10438: Here I doubt there’s need of magic spells:            6375
10439: The ghosts will find this place for themselves.

10443: 
10444: The Herald
10445: 
10446: My ancient duty, to announce the play,
10447: Is thwarted by the Spirits’ secret action:
10448: Please forgive: there’s no sensible way
10449: To explain such confused transformation.                      6380

10451: The emperor’s high up, by the wall:
10452: He can see the battles on the tapestry
10453: From mighty ages: watching comfortably.
10454: Here they all sit now, Prince, Court around,                  6385
10455: Benches packed together, as background:
10456: In this hour of spirits, too, the lovers
10457: Have lovingly found room beside their lovers.
10458: And now that all have found their proper places,
10459: We’re ready: let the spirits show their faces!                6390
10460: 
10461: (Trumpets.)
10462: 
10463: The Astrologer
10464: 
10465: Begin the drama then without delay,
10466: The Emperor commands: take walls away!
10467: No further hindrance, here magic is at hand:
10468: The Tapestry’s shrivelled as if by burning brand.
10469: The walls divide, and sweep apart, as one,                    6395
10470: An empty stage it seems has been created,
10471: A mysterious light falls on our faces,
10472: And I climb up to the proscenium.
10473: Mephistopheles (Rising to view in the prompter’s box.)
10474: 
10475: From here I hope for general acclamation,
10476: Prompting is the devil’s true oration.                         6400
10477: 
10478: (To the Astrologer.)
10479: 
10480: You know the measures that all the stars obey,
10481: You’ll understand my whispers in a masterly way.
10482: 
10483: The Astrologer
10484: 
10485: By miraculous power appears to view,
10486: A massive temple-front: it’s ancient too.
10487: Like Atlas, who once held up the sky,                          6405
10488: The many rows of columns stand on high.
10489: They might well bear the stony weight,
10490: Since two could raise a building straight.
10491: 
10492: The Architect
10493: 
10494: That’s the antique! It doesn’t earn my praise,
10495: Clumsy, overstretched we call it, nowadays.                    6410
10496: Men think that crude is noble: bulk is greatness.
10497: I love slender shafts, uplifting, boundless:
10498: A pointed arch sends the spirit to the sky:
10499: Architecture such as that will edify.
10500: 
10501: The Astrologer
10502: 
10503: Receive with reverence these hours the stars allow:            6415
10504: Let words of magic bind pure Reason now:
10505: Let marvellously daring Fantasy,
10506: In return, sweep onward, wide and free.
10507: Your eyes see what you daringly conceived:
10508: It’s impossible, so more worthy to be believed.                6420
10509: 
10510: (Faust rises into view on the other side of the proscenium.)
10511: In priestly vestments, crowned, a wondrous man,
10512: Fulfilling what he confidently began.
10513: A tripod rises with him from deep abyss,
10514: I smell the odour of incense in the dish.
10515: He prepares to bless this sacred labour:           6425
10516: From this moment on it will find favour.
10517: 
10518: Faust (Sublimely.)
10519: 
10520: In your name, Mothers, you enthroned
10521: In boundlessness, set eternally alone,
10522: And yet together. All the Forms of Life
10523: Float round your heads, active, not alive.         6430
10524: Whatever was, in all its glow and gleam,
10525: Moves there still, since it must always be.
10526: And you assign it, with omnipotent might,
10527: To day’s pavilion or the vault of night.
10528: Life holds some fast on its sweet track,           6435
10529: Others the bold magician must bring back:
10530: Filled with faith, and richly generous,
10531: He shows, what each desires, the Marvellous.
10532: 
10533: The Astrologer
10534: 
10535: The glowing key has scarcely touched the dish,
10536: At once the room is filled with darkened mist:     6440
10537: It swirls about, as puffs of cloud will do,
10538: Grows, condenses, shrinks, and splits in two.
10539: And now behold a spirit-masterpiece!
10540: As it moves about, there’s music without cease.
10541: In heavenly tones, pours out a who-knows-how,      6445
10542: And while it moves, all’s turned to melody now.
10543: The pillared shafts, even the tri-glyph, ringing
10544: I think that the whole temple’s singing.
10545: The dark sinks down: from the light mist,
10546: A handsome youth steps out in time to it.          6450
10547: I needn’t name him, so my task is finished,
10548: Who doesn’t know the name of charming Paris!
10549: A Lady
10550: 
10551: O! What a shining healthy powerful youth!
10552: 
10553: A Second
10554: 
10555: Like a peach, so fresh and full of juice!
10556: 
10557: A Third
10558: 
10559: The finely delineated, sweetly swelling lip!   6455
10560: 
10561: A Fourth
10562: 
10563: From such a cup you’d surely like to sip?
10564: 
10565: A Fifth
10566: 
10567: He’s quite pretty, but a little unrefined.
10568: 
10569: A Sixth
10570: 
10571: He could be a bit more graceful, to my mind.
10572: 
10573: A Knight
10574: 
10575: I sense the shepherd here, I think,
10576: No trace of Courtier or Prince.                6460
10577: 
10578: Another
10579: 
10580: Yes! Half naked the youth’s quite handsome
10581: We’d need to see him first with armour on!
10582: 
10583: A Lady
10584: 
10585: He sits down so gently and pleasantly.
10586: A Knight
10587: 
10588: You’d like to sit on his lap, comfortably?
10589: 
10590: Another
10591: 
10592: He lifts his arm so lightly above his head.       6465
10593: 
10594: A Chamberlain
10595: 
10596: The lout! That’s not acceptable: how ill-bred!
10597: 
10598: A Lady
10599: 
10600: You lords find fault with everything.
10601: 
10602: The Chamberlain
10603: 
10604: In the Emperor’s presence, all that stretching!
10605: 
10606: The Lady
10607: 
10608: He’s posed there! He thinks he’s quite alone.
10609: 
10610: The Chamberlain
10611: 
10612: Even a play should be polite in tone.             6470
10613: 
10614: The Lady
10615: 
10616: Now sleep has overcome the charming boy.
10617: 
10618: The Chamberlain
10619: 
10620: And now he’ll snore: that’s natural, what joy!
10621: A Young Lady
10622: 
10623: What refreshes my heart so deeply, that fragrance
10624: Mixed with fumes from the burning incense?
10625: 
10626: An Older Lady
10627: 
10628: Truly! It’s breath penetrates one’s nature,          6475
10629: It comes from him!
10630: 
10631: An Elderly lady
10632: 
10633:                 It’s the sap of nurture,
10634: It’s generated in youth, like ambrosia,
10635: And spreads around in the atmosphere.
10636: 
10637: (Helen emerges.)
10638: 
10639: Mephistopheles
10640: 
10641: So that’s her! I’d not lose sleep for that. She
10642: Is quite pretty, true, but doesn’t do much for me.   6480
10643: 
10644: The Astrologer
10645: 
10646: There’s nothing more now for me to do,
10647: As men of honour confess, I confess it too.
10648: Beauty comes: if only I’d a tongue of fire! –
10649: Beauty so many songs has forever inspired –
10650: Whom she appears to, of self he’s dispossessed,      6485
10651: Whom she belonged to, was too greatly blessed.
10652: 
10653: Faust
10654: 
10655: Is this the fount of beauty? Have I still, eyes?
10656: What pours here, through my mind, so richly?
10657: My dreadful journey yields a blessed prize.
10658: How void the world was, undeveloped for me!          6490
10659: What is it now since my priesthood?
10660: Desirable, lasting, solid underfoot!
10661: The power of my life’s breath should
10662: Fail, if I’m ever again estranged from you! –
10663: The perfect form that drew me before,              6495
10664: Delighting me, in the magic mirror,
10665: Was only an airy phantom of such beauty! – You
10666: Are the true embodiment of my passion:
10667: Towards you is my powers’ whole direction
10668: To you, love, feeling, faith, madness are owed.    6500
10669: 
10670: Mephistopheles (From the prompter’s box.)
10671: 
10672: Calm yourself, now, and don’t fail in your role!
10673: 
10674: An Older Lady
10675: 
10676: Tall, well formed, only the head is small.
10677: 
10678: A Younger Lady
10679: 
10680: Just look! Could clumsier feet exist at all?
10681: 
10682: A Diplomat
10683: 
10684: I’ve seen princesses of this kind: though
10685: I think she’s beautiful, from head to toe.         6505
10686: 
10687: A Courtier
10688: 
10689: Soft and sly, she goes towards the sleeper.
10690: 
10691: A Lady
10692: 
10693: How ugly, near that form so young and pure.
10694: 
10695: A Poet
10696: 
10697: From her Beauty shines towards him.
10698: A Lady
10699: 
10700: A picture! Luna and Endymion!
10701: 
10702: The Poet
10703: 
10704: Quite so! The goddess seems to descend,           6510
10705: Leans above him to drink his breath, ah then:
10706: Enviable! – A Kiss! – The cup’s full to excess.
10707: 
10708: A Duenna
10709: 
10710: In front of everyone! What utter madness!
10711: 
10712: Faust
10713: 
10714: A dreadful favour to grant a boy! –
10715: 
10716: Mephistopheles
10717: 
10718:                Quiet now! Be still!
10719: And let the spectre do what it will.              6515
10720: 
10721: A Courtier
10722: 
10723: She slips away, lightly: he awakes.
10724: 
10725: A Lady
10726: 
10727: Just as I thought! That glance she takes!
10728: 
10729: A Courtier
10730: 
10731: He stares! It’s wonderful what’s happening.
10732: 
10733: A Lady
10734: 
10735: But not so wonderful what she sees in him.
10736: A Courtier
10737: 
10738: She turns towards him now with dignity.           6520
10739: 
10740: A Lady
10741: 
10742: I see she’ll soon take him through his lesson:
10743: At such times men behave quite stupidly,
10744: Perhaps he even thinks that’s he the first one.
10745: 
10746: A Knight
10747: 
10748: Let me be worthy! Majestically fine! –
10749: 
10750: A Lady
10751: 
10752: The trollop! I’d call that table wine!            6525
10753: 
10754: A Page
10755: 
10756: I’d like to swap his place for mine!
10757: 
10758: A Courtier
10759: 
10760: Who wouldn’t be tangled in such a net?
10761: 
10762: A Lady
10763: 
10764: That treasure’s been handled often, you forget,
10765: And the gilding’s mostly rubbed away.
10766: 
10767: Another
10768: 
10769: Worthless since it was ten years old, I’d say.    6530
10770: 
10771: A Knight
10772: 
10773: Sometimes one takes the best that one can get:
10774: I’d be content with the loveliness that’s left.
10775: A Learned Man
10776: 
10777: I see clearly but I’ll confess, quite freely,
10778: It’s doubtful if that’s the true one I see.
10779: The Present’s tempted to exaggerate,              6535
10780: I hold to what the ancient texts relate.
10781: There I read she gave particular joy
10782: To all the grey-bearded men of Troy:
10783: And that fits perfectly here too, you see:
10784: I’m not young: still she gives joy to me.         6540
10785: 
10786: The Astrologer
10787: 
10788: No longer a boy! A daring hero, he:
10789: Grasped she defends herself, but barely.
10790: He lifts her high in his strong arms, too,
10791: Will he carry her off?
10792: 
10793: Faust
10794:                            Audacious fool!
10795: You dare? Do you hear? Stop! Enough, I say!       6545
10796: 
10797: Mephistopheles
10798: 
10799: You created the mime these phantoms play!
10800: 
10801: The Astrologer
10802: 
10803: A word! After what we’ve been given,
10804: I’ll call this piece: The Rape of Helen.
10805: 
10806: Faust
10807: 
10808: What rape! Am I nothing in this place!
10809: Is this key no longer in my hand!                 6550
10810: It led me through terror, waste and wave,
10811: Through solitude, to where, set firm, I stand.
10812: Here’s a foothold! Here’s reality,
10813: Where spirit dare with spirits disagree,
10814: And prepare itself for its great, dual mastery.   6555
10815: She was so far: how could she closer shine!
10816: I’ll rescue her, and she’ll be doubly mine.
10817: The risk! The Mothers! They must grant her!
10818: Who knows her once, can never live without her.
10819: 
10820: The Astrologer
10821: 
10822: What are you doing, Faust! Faust! –With force                            6560
10823: He seizes her, the form dims in its course.
10824: He turns the key against the youth, and then,
10825: Touches him! – Ah! – Gone, in a moment! Gone!
10826: 
10827: (An explosion. Faust falls to the ground. The spirits vanish in mist.)
10828: 
10829: Mephistopheles (Taking Faust on his shoulders.)
10830: 
10831: You’ve done it now! Carrying fools, my friend,
10832: Brings harm to the Devil himself, in the end.                            6565
10833: 
10834: (Darkness. Tumult.)
10835: Part II Act II Scene I: A High-Arched, Narrow, Gothic Chamber
10836: Formerly Faust’s, Unchanged
10837: 
10838: Mephistopheles (Entering from behind a curtain. As he holds it up and
10839: looks behind him, Faust is seen lying stretched out on an antiquated bed.)
10840: 
10841: Lie there, unlucky man! One tempted by
10842: The bonds of a love not readily undone!
10843: The man whom Helena shall paralyse
10844: Won’t find it easy to regain his reason.
10845: 
10846: (Looking around him.)
10847: 
10848: I look upwards, here, around me,                                        6570
10849: All’s unaltered, and undamaged:
10850: Stained glass, there, shows darkly,
10851: Spiders have added to their webs:
10852: The ink is dry: the paper’s yellow,
10853: But everything’s still in its place:                                    6575
10854: Even the quill-pen’s here, on show,
10855: With which Faust and the Devil embraced.
10856: Yes! Deeper in the nib there’s still
10857: A drop of blood, I tempted him to spill.
10858: It’s a unique piece, in my book,                                        6580
10859: So I’ll wish the great collectors luck.
10860: The old fur-robe, on the hook, too,
10861: Reminds me of a joke or two,
10862: That time when I taught the student,
10863: What, perhaps, in youth, he’s glad he learnt.                           6585
10864: Truly the same desire is on me, for
10865: You, smoke-singed gown: you and I,
10866: To flaunt ourselves once more as a professor,
10867: And speak as one who’s always in the right.
10868: How to achieve that all the learned know:                               6590
10869: It’s something the Devil lost long ago.
10870: 
10871: (He shakes the fur as he takes it down, and moths, crickets and beetles fly
10872: out.)
10873: Chorus of Insects
10874: 
10875: Greetings! We’re greeting
10876: Our Patron of old,
10877: We’re floating and buzzing,
10878: To us you’re well known.                          6595
10879: Singly, in silence,
10880: You sowed us like plants.
10881: Father, in thousands
10882: We’ve come to the dance.
10883: The jester is snugly                              6600
10884: Contained in the breast,
10885: The lice in the fur they
10886: Are sooner expressed.
10887: 
10888: Mephistopheles
10889: 
10890: What a nice surprise, this young brood of mine!
10891: One merely sows, and harvests in due time.        6605
10892: I’ll shake this ancient fleece about,
10893: Here and there, one flutters out. –
10894: Away! Around! In a hundred leavings,
10895: Hurry and hide yourself, you darlings.
10896: There, where the ancient boxes lie,               6610
10897: Here, in the smoky parchment try,
10898: In that broken dusty old pottery,
10899: Or the skull, its eye-sockets empty.
10900: All this jumbled mildewed existence,
10901: Always gives one whims and fancies.               6615
10902: Again let’s dress up as a lecturer!
10903: Today I’ll be the Principal, once more.
10904: But it’s no use naming myself, you see:
10905: Where are the people, to welcome me?
10906: Famulus (A College Servant, tottering here, down the long gallery)
10907: 
10908: What a noise! What a quake!                                          6620
10909: The stairs sway, the walls shake:
10910: Through the windows’ trembling colours
10911: I see the lightning gleam above us.
10912: The floor leaps, and, on high,
10913: Plaster, rubble from the sky.                                        6625
10914: And the door, once tightly locked,
10915: By wondrous force is thrown back. –
10916: There! How fearful! A giant
10917: Look, in Faust’s old garment!
10918: At his gazing, and his pleas,                                        6630
10919: I want to sink to my knees.
10920: Shall I go? Shall I remain?
10921: Oh, what will happen to me, then!
10922: 
10923: Mephistopheles
10924: 
10925: Here, my friend! – You’re called Nicodemus.
10926: 
10927: Famulus
10928: 
10929: Honoured Sir! That’s my name – Oremus.                               6635
10930: 
10931: Mephistopheles
10932: 
10933: Enough of that!
10934: 
10935: Famulus
10936: 
10937:    How pleased I am you knew me!
10938: 
10939: Mephistopheles
10940: 
10941: I know you well: a student still, I see,
10942: Mossy Sir! After all, a learned man
10943: Studies hard, and does the best he can.
10944: So one builds a respectable house of cards,                          6640
10945: That greater minds can’t finish afterwards.
10946: But he’s a witty fellow, is your master,
10947: Who doesn’t know the noble Doctor Wagner?
10948: He’s the first in all the world of learning!
10949: He’s unique: wisdom, each day increasing,
10950: And all of it he still holds together,           6645
10951: Crowds, around him, panting, gather
10952: Listeners, eaves’-droppers, welcome.
10953: Alone, he shines there at the rostrum.
10954: He holds a key, just like Saint Peter,           6650
10955: That unlocks the lower, and the higher.
10956: He glows and sparkles above the rest,
10957: No name and fame has wider standing:
10958: Even that of Faust has dimmed, at best:
10959: He’s the one who’s always inventing.             6655
10960: 
10961: Famulus
10962: 
10963: Forgive me, honoured Sir, if I dare
10964: To speak, and contradict you, there:
10965: There’s no question of that, I must declare:
10966: Since modesty’s his role, as all discern.
10967: Discovering nothing of the circumstances,        6660
10968: Baffled by the great man’s disappearance:
10969: He seeks all health and comfort in his return.
10970: The room waits for its old master
10971: While Doctor Faustus is away,
10972: Untouched, still, as in his day.                 6665
10973: And I scarcely dare to enter.
10974: What can the stars be doing? –
10975: The walls themselves are frightening me:
10976: The doorframes quiver, bolts work free,
10977: Or you yourself couldn’t have got in.            6670
10978: 
10979: Mephistopheles
10980: 
10981: And your great man where is he?
10982: Lead me there: or bring him here to me!
10983: Famulus
10984: 
10985: Oh! His warnings are quite clear,
10986: I’m not allowed to interfere.
10987: For months I’ve left him in utter peace,                  6675
10988: Till his great work is complete.
10989: He, the most delicate of scholars,
10990: His face looks like a charcoal burner’s,
10991: Blackened now from nose to ears,
10992: Eyes crimson, blowing up the fires,                       6680
10993: All the while, so enthusiastic:
10994: Clinking of tongs, that’s his music.
10995: 
10996: Mephistopheles
10997: 
10998: Why would he deny an entrance to me?
10999: I’m one who’d speed his luck, you see.
11000: 
11001: (The Famulus exits: Mephistopheles sits down, gravely.)
11002: 
11003: I’ve hardly taken my seat here,                           6685
11004: And I see a guest behind my chair.
11005: But he’s one of the new school’s persuasion:
11006: He’ll be arrogant, I think, on this occasion.
11007: 
11008: Baccalaureus (Storming along the corridor.)
11009: 
11010: I find the gates and doors are open!
11011: Now there’s room at last for hope then,                   6690
11012: That it won’t be merely as before,
11013: A live man, acting as a corpse,
11014: Wasting away, and rotting,
11015: Till he merely dies of living.
11016: 
11017: These walls and these partitions,                         6695
11018: Bow and sink towards perdition,
11019: And if we don’t look about us,
11020: Their decline and fall will rout us.
11021: I’m audacious, no one more so,
11022: But no further in do I go.                                6700
11023: What will I find here today?
11024: It’s years since I’ve been this way,
11025: Where timid and innocent
11026: As a freshman I was sent!
11027: Where I trusted in my elders,             6705
11028: Edified by all their blather.
11029: 
11030: From the dry old books, they knew
11031: They lied to me: what they knew,
11032: Not believing in it truly,
11033: Stealing life itself, from me.            6710
11034: What? – There, in his cell,
11035: Sits a darkly bright one still!
11036: 
11037: With astonishment now, nearer,
11038: See him sitting in his dark fur,
11039: Truly, as I left him sitting              6715
11040: Still in all his coarse wrapping!
11041: Then he seemed a fount of wisdom,
11042: Since I didn’t understand him.
11043: He won’t find me so today,
11044: Fresh and new, I’m on my way!             6720
11045: 
11046: Sir, if in Lethe’s melancholy stream
11047: That bald nodding head’s not swum,
11048: See your grateful scholar come,
11049: Outgrown, his academic dream.
11050: I find you now, as I saw you:             6725
11051: I was another though: that’s true.
11052: 
11053: Mephistopheles
11054: 
11055: I’m glad the ringing brought you.
11056: I rated you once before as high:
11057: The caterpillar, the chrysalis too,
11058: Showed the bright future butterfly.       6730
11059: Your curly hair and pointed collar,
11060: Made you a childishly pleasing scholar.
11061: You never wore pigtails I believe? –
11062: And today you’re cropped like a Swede.
11063: I see you’re bold and resolute:                         6735
11064: But don’t go home too absolute!
11065: 
11066: Baccalaureus
11067: 
11068: My old master! We’re in our old places:
11069: But don’t think to renew time’s journey,
11070: And spare me words with dual-faces:
11071: I treat them now quite differently.                     6740
11072: You teased the true, and honest youth.
11073: It wasn’t difficult for you to do
11074: It’s what no one dares to do today.
11075: 
11076: Mephistopheles
11077: 
11078: Pure truth on the young is thrown away,
11079: The little beaks don’t like it, any way,                6745
11080: But afterwards when years have passed,
11081: And they’ve learnt it for themselves at last,
11082: And think it came from them, not school:
11083: Then we hear: ‘The Master was a fool.’
11084: 
11085: Baccalaureus
11086: 
11087: A rascal, maybe! – What teacher ever shows us           6750
11088: The Truth directly, underneath our noses?
11089: They know the way to make it seem more, or less,
11090: Now serious, now playful, as suits the children best.
11091: 
11092: Mephistopheles
11093: 
11094: There’s a moment given us for learning, truly:
11095: But you’re ready now to teach, yourself, I see.         6755
11096: For many moons, united with their suns,
11097: You the riches of experience have won.
11098: Baccalaureus
11099: 
11100: Experience! Mist and Foam!
11101: And not the Spirit’s equal.
11102: Confess! What one has known,                       6760
11103: Is not worth knowing at all.
11104: 
11105: Mephistopheles (After a pause.)
11106: 
11107: I’ve thought so for ages. I was a Fool,
11108: But I think that shallow now I’m sensible.
11109: 
11110: Baccalaureus
11111: 
11112: That pleases me! I hear pure Reason’s sound:
11113: The first old man of sense I’ve ever found.        6765
11114: 
11115: Mephistopheles
11116: 
11117: I sought for treasure, buried gold,
11118: And brought to light frightful coals.
11119: 
11120: Baccalaureus
11121: 
11122: Confess now, your skull, bald and old,
11123: Is worth no more than that empty poll.
11124: 
11125: Mephistopheles (Amiably.)
11126: 
11127: Do you know, my friend, how rude you seem to me?   6770
11128: 
11129: Baccalaureus
11130: 
11131: In German, one’s lying if one speaks politely.
11132: Mephistopheles (Wheeling his chair nearer to the proscenium and the
11133: audience.)
11134: 
11135: Up here I’m dazed by light and air:
11136: Shall I take shelter with you down there?
11137: 
11138: Baccalaureus
11139: 
11140: I find it arrogant that in times like these,
11141: A man wants to be what he no longer is.                           6775
11142: Man’s life is in his arteries, and when
11143: Are they so vibrant as in younger men?
11144: There the fresh blood full of strength
11145: Creates new life from its own life again.
11146: There all works, and things get done,                             6780
11147: The waverers fall, the capable get on.
11148: While we’ve conquered half the world,
11149: What have you done? Nodded, curled
11150: In the sun, dreamed, weighed, plan on plan.
11151: For sure, age is a chilling fever:                                6785
11152: The frost of whims and need ahead.
11153: When your thirtieth year is over,
11154: A man’s as good as dead.
11155: It would be best to seek an early grave.
11156: 
11157: Mephistopheles
11158: 
11159: That leaves the Devil nothing more to say.                        6790
11160: 
11161: Baccalaureus
11162: 
11163: Unless I will it, no Devil can exist.
11164: 
11165: Mephistopheles (Aside.)
11166: 
11167: The Devil will still trip you, in a bit.
11168: 
11169: Baccalaureus
11170: 
11171: This is youth’s noblest profession!
11172: The world was nothing before my creation:
11173: I drew the Sun out of the sea:                                  6795
11174: The Moon began her changeful course with me:
11175: The daylight decked my path to greet me,
11176: The Earth flowered, grew green, to meet me.
11177: At my command, in primal night,
11178: The stars in splendour swam to sight.                           6800
11179: Who, but I, loosed from its prison
11180: Cramped thought’s philistinism?
11181: I, quite free, as my spirit cites,
11182: Happily following my inner light,
11183: And speeding on, in delight,                                    6805
11184: Darkness behind: and all before me, bright.
11185: 
11186: Mephistopheles
11187: 
11188: Go forth in splendour, you primal man! –
11189: How could insight harm you, ever:
11190: Who can think of stupid things or clever,
11191: That past ages didn’t, long ago, understand.                    6810
11192: Yet there’s no danger from him, you see,
11193: He’ll think about it differently in time:
11194: Even if the grape-juice acts absurdly,
11195: In the end it changes into wine.
11196: 
11197: (To the younger members of the audience, who do not applaud.)
11198: 
11199: My words have left you cold, I gather,
11200: May it be so for you, sweet children:
11201: But think: the Devil’s a lot older,
11202: So you need to be old to understand him!
11203: Part II Act II Scene II: A Laboratory
11204: 
11205: (In the fashion of the Middle Ages: lots of heavy apparatus for strange
11206: purposes.)
11207: 
11208: Wagner (At the furnace.)
11209: 
11210: The fearful bell is sounding,
11211: The soot-black walls shudder.                                             6820
11212: My deepest expectation
11213: Will be unsure no longer.
11214: Soon the dark itself will lighten:
11215: Soon in the innermost phial,
11216: It will glow like living fire,                                            6825
11217: Yes, like the noblest ruby’s glow,
11218: Lightning flashing in the shadow.
11219: A clearest white light shines now!
11220: Ah, not to lose it once more! –
11221: Oh, God! Who’s rattling at the door?                                      6830
11222: 
11223: Mephistopheles (Entering.)
11224: 
11225: Greetings! And kindly meant now.
11226: 
11227: Wagner (Anxiously.)
11228: 
11229: Welcome, to the planet of the hour!
11230: 
11231: (Whispering.)
11232: 
11233: But stifle your breath, and words’ power,
11234: A noble work is likewise being weighed.
11235: 
11236: Mephistopheles (Whispering.)
11237: 
11238: What might it be?
11239: 
11240: Wagner (Whispering.)
11241: 
11242:                     A Man is being made.                                  6835
11243: Mephistopheles
11244: 
11245: A Man? And what loving couple
11246: Have you got hidden, up the chimney?
11247: 
11248: Wagner
11249: 
11250: God Forbid! How unfashionable!
11251: We’re free of all that idle foolery.
11252: The tender moment from which life emerged,        6840
11253: The charming power with which its inner urge,
11254: Took and gave, and clearly stamped its seal,
11255: First in a near, and then a further field,
11256: We now divest of all that dignity:
11257: Though the creatures still enjoy it, we,          6845
11258: As Men, with all our greater gifts, begin,
11259: To have, as we should, a nobler origin.
11260: 
11261: (He turns towards the furnace.)
11262: 
11263: It brightens! See! – Now there’s a real chance,
11264: That, if from the hundred-fold substance,
11265: By mixing – since mixing makes it happen –        6850
11266: The stuff of human life’s compounded,
11267: And distilled in a flask, well-founded,
11268: And in proper combination, grounded,
11269: Then the silent work is done.
11270: 
11271: (He turns again to the furnace.)
11272: 
11273: It will be! The mass is clearer!                  6855
11274: The proof comes nearer, nearer:
11275: What man praises in deepest Nature,
11276: Through Reason we dare to probe it,
11277: And what she organises, here,
11278: We’re now able to crystallise it.                 6860
11279: Mephistopheles
11280: 
11281: Who lives a while, gains much experience,
11282: And nothing new can happen on his journey.
11283: In years of travelling, and in my presence,
11284: I’ve seen, already, crystallised humanity.
11285: 
11286: Wagner (Up till now attending to the phial.)
11287: 
11288: It rises: flashes, there’s expansion           6865
11289: In a moment more it will be done.
11290: Great aims seem foolish at the outset:
11291: But we’ll laugh at Chance itself, yet,
11292: And brains, with thoughts to celebrate,
11293: In the future, a Thinker will create.          6870
11294: 
11295: (He inspects the phial, rapturously.)
11296: 
11297: The glass rings with sweet power,
11298: It darkens, clears: it must have being!
11299: In a delicate form I see appear
11300: A well-behaved little Man behaving.
11301: What can the world ask more, what can we?      6875
11302: Now that this mystery’s visible to each.
11303: Give ear to what these sounds may be,
11304: They make a voice: they’re forming speech.
11305: 
11306: Homunculus (From the phial, to Wagner.)
11307: 
11308: Now, father! That was no joke. How are you?
11309: Come: press me tenderly to your heart, too!    6880
11310: But not too hard, the glass may be too thin.
11311: It’s in the very nature of the thing:
11312: For the natural the world has barely space:
11313: What’s artificial commands a narrow place.
11314: 
11315: (To Mephistopheles.)
11316: 
11317: But you, Rascal, my dear Cousin, are you       6885
11318: Here at the right moment? I thank you, too.
11319: Good fortune’s led you here to me:
11320: Since I exist, I must be doing, you see.
11321: I’d like to begin my work today:
11322: You’re skilful at shortening the way.                            6890
11323: 
11324: Wagner
11325: 
11326: But first, a word! Till now I’ve had no direction,
11327: When old or young teased me with a question.
11328: For example: no one’s found out, ever,
11329: What makes body and soul fit together:
11330: Stick tight, as if there’ll be no separation,                    6895
11331: Yet always cause each other irritation.
11332: So then, -
11333: 
11334: Mephistopheles
11335: 
11336:                 Stop! I’d rather he told me,
11337: Why married people get by so wretchedly?
11338: You’ll never discover that, my friend.
11339: There’s work to do the little Man can tend.                      6900
11340: 
11341: Homunculus
11342: 
11343: What work’s to do?
11344: 
11345: Mephistopheles (Pointing to a side door.)
11346: 
11347:              Employ your gifts on this!
11348: 
11349: Wagner (Still gazing at the phial.)
11350: 
11351: Truly, you’re the loveliest boy there is!
11352: 
11353: (The side-door opens: Faust is seen stretched out on a couch.)
11354: Homunculus (Astonished.)
11355: 
11356: Interesting!
11357: 
11358: (The phial slips out of Wagner’s hands, hovers over Faust, and shines on
11359: him.)
11360: 
11361:        Lovely surroundings! – Clear water
11362: In thick forest! Women there: undressing.
11363: The loveliest of all! – It’s getting clearer.                        6905
11364: One’s left, different from the rest, gleaming:
11365: Of highest race, for sure, a heavenly name.
11366: She places her foot in the transparent glow,
11367: Her noble body’s sweetly living flame
11368: Cools itself in the yielding crystal flow. –                         6910
11369: But what’s that rush of beating wings for:
11370: That thrashing, splashing, in the mirror?
11371: The lovely girls, intimidated, flee:
11372: Their queen, alone, looks on, composedly,
11373: To see, with a proud feminine pleasure,                              6915
11374: The Swan-Prince press against her knee, there,
11375: Forward yet tame. Familiar, he seems. –
11376: But suddenly a vapour heaves,
11377: And covers, with the veil it weaves,
11378: The loveliest of scenes.                                             6920
11379: 
11380: Mephistopheles
11381: 
11382: All the things that you could murmur!
11383: So little: and such a great dreamer.
11384: I see nothing –
11385: 
11386: Homunculus
11387: 
11388:         So I believe. You’re Northern,
11389: In the age of mist you’re born then,                                 6925
11390: In a jumble of priest-craft and chivalry,
11391: So how could your sight be free!
11392: You’re at home with darkness.
11393: (He gazes around.)
11394: 
11395: Brown repulsive, mildewed walls,
11396: Low, pointed arches, full of scrolls! –
11397: One wakes, and gives another pain,         6930
11398: On the spot, dead then, he’ll remain.
11399: Wooded founts, swans, naked beauty,
11400: That was his far-sighted dream:
11401: How could this place do duty!
11402: I can scarcely endure the scene.           6935
11403: Carry him off!
11404: 
11405: Mephistopheles
11406: 
11407:   I’d be happy: a last chance.
11408: 
11409: Homunculus
11410: 
11411: Order the soldier to the fight,
11412: Lead the maiden to the dance,
11413: Then everything’s done right.
11414: Even now, thinks, quick as light,          6940
11415: It’s Classical Walpurgis Night:
11416: That’s the best, if he were sent
11417: To his own true element!
11418: 
11419: Mephistopheles
11420: 
11421: I’ve never heard that event named, here.
11422: 
11423: Homunculus
11424: 
11425: How could it come to your ear?             6945
11426: Only Romantic ghosts, for you:
11427: A true ghost must be Classic too.
11428: Mephistopheles
11429: 
11430: Which path do we take there? Already
11431: Your antique colleagues quite repel me.
11432: 
11433: Homunculus
11434: 
11435: North-westward Satan, is your pleasure ground,        6950
11436: But this time we’re South-eastward bound –
11437: In wider space flows Peneus, the free
11438: By bushes, groves, and damp still bays:
11439: Its levels stretch to mountain ways,
11440: And over it Pharsalus: old, yet contemporary.         6955
11441: 
11442: Mephistopheles
11443: 
11444: Oh! Enough! And keep all the fight,
11445: Of tyranny and slavery, out of sight.
11446: It bores me: they’re scarce done when
11447: They start the whole thing over again:
11448: And no one sees: they’re being re-aligned,            6960
11449: By Asmodeus, who works them from behind.
11450: They clash, it’s said, for Freedom’s right:
11451: Seen rightly, slave with slave is all the fight.
11452: 
11453: Homunculus
11454: 
11455: Leave Mankind’s wilfulness to me, then.
11456: Each man defends himself, as best he can,             6965
11457: From childhood, till, at last, he is a man.
11458: Just ask how we can get back there again.
11459: Have you a method, then, let’s see:
11460: If you haven’t, leave it all to me.
11461: 
11462: Mephistopheles
11463: 
11464: There’s many a Brocken trick I could display,         6970
11465: But I find that Pagan bolts have barred the way.
11466: The whole Greek race was never that much use!
11467: They dazzle with the senses’ freer play: it’s true:
11468: They lure the heart of man to happier sins:
11469: While ours, one always finds, are gloomy things.   6975
11470: And now, what?
11471: 
11472: Homunculus
11473: 
11474:             Once you weren’t so witless:
11475: When I spoke about Thessalian witches.
11476: I can deliver what I said: just think a little.
11477: 
11478: Mephistopheles (Lustfully.)
11479: 
11480: Thessalian witches! Good! They’re the people
11481: I once enquired about long ago.                    6980
11482: I don’t think it would suit me, at all,
11483: To live with them night after night, though,
11484: Still, a visit, and a trial –
11485: 
11486: Homunculus
11487: 
11488:                  This mantle here,
11489: Fold it around your knight there!                  6985
11490: As before, the cloak can carry another,
11491: One of you, along with the other.
11492: I’ll light the way.
11493: 
11494: Wagner (Anxiously.)
11495: 
11496:                      And I?
11497: 
11498: Homunculus
11499: 
11500:                               Well, now, you
11501: Stay home, there are important things to do.
11502: Unfold all your ancient parchments,
11503: Then, by rote, collect life’s elements,            6990
11504: And place them together with due care,
11505: Consider What, more deeply consider How.
11506: Meanwhile round the world, a bit, I’ll fare,
11507: And find the last dot on the ‘i’, for now.
11508: Then the great work will see its final stage:       6995
11509: Great effort will merit great reward, you’ll see:
11510: Gold, honour, fame, a long and ripe old age,
11511: And science too – and virtue, possibly.
11512: Farewell!
11513: 
11514: Wagner (Sadly.)
11515: 
11516:            Farewell! It gives me pain.
11517: Already, I fear, I’ll not see you again.            7000
11518: 
11519: Mephistopheles
11520: 
11521: Now to Peneus, lively, on!
11522: Sir Cousin’s highly rated.
11523: 
11524: (To the audience.)
11525: 
11526: In the end we’re dependent on
11527: The creatures we’ve created.
11528: Part II Act II Scene III: Classical Walpurgis Night.
11529: The Pharsalian Fields.
11530: 
11531: (Darkness.)
11532: 
11533: Erichtho (The Thessalian Witch, see Lucan’s Pharsalia)
11534: 
11535: This night’s awesome feast, as so often in the past,        7005
11536: I enter now, I, Erichtho, the gloomy one:
11537: Not so abominable as the wretched poets
11538: Painted me, with excessive slander…they never
11539: Cease their blame or praise…I see the valley whiten
11540: With waves of tents that gleam greyer in the distance,      7010
11541: The after-image of that anxious, fearful night.
11542: How often it’s repeated! In eternity
11543: Acted out, again, forever…No one gives the realm
11544: To another: to the one whose power won it:
11545: Whose strength rules. Since each, incapable of ruling       7015
11546: His inner self, would gladly rule his neighbour’s will,
11547: In the manner that his proud mind dictates to him…
11548: But here a great instance was fought out, to the end,
11549: Of how force may battle against a greater force,
11550: Freedom’s lovely thousand-blossomed garland be torn,        7020
11551: And stubborn laurel be wound round the ruler’s brow.
11552: Here, Pompey dreams of his youth and former greatness,
11553: There, Caesar, listening, watches the balance tremble!
11554: It settles, and the world knows whom it sinks towards.
11555: The watch fires, glowing, send out their crimson flames:    7025
11556: The field exhales those images of squandered blood,
11557: And lured by the strange wondrous splendour of the night,
11558: A legion of Hellenic legends gather here.
11559: They hover around all the fires uncertainly,
11560: Or sit nearby, the fabled forms of ancient days….           7030
11561: The Moon, not full it is true, but of clearest light,
11562: Rises, scattering mild radiance everywhere:
11563: The ghostly tents vanish: the fires burn bluish now.
11564: But, over my head, what sudden meteor’s this?
11565: It shines, illuminates the material globe.                  7035
11566: I smell Life. It’s not fitting for me to approach
11567: Closer to the living, since I’m harmful to them:
11568: It gives me a bad name, and is no benefit to me.
11569: It sinks down already. I give way, thoughtfully!
11570: 
11571: (She Exits. The Airy Travellers speak from above.)
11572: 
11573: Homunculus
11574: 
11575: Once again float round the circle                    7040
11576: Over flames and shuddering horror:
11577: On the ground, and in the vale still,
11578: It’s quite ghostly, we discover.
11579: 
11580: Mephistopheles
11581: 
11582: It’s the same as through my old window
11583: In the grim and tangled north,                       7045
11584: Really loathsome ghosts below,
11585: I’m at home here: and there, of course.
11586: 
11587: Homunculus
11588: 
11589: See! There’s a tall one striding,
11590: With gigantic steps, before us.
11591: 
11592: Mephistopheles
11593: 
11594: As if she were afraid, now: gliding                  7050
11595: Through the air above, she saw us.
11596: 
11597: Homunculus
11598: 
11599: Let her stride! Right away,
11600: Set the knight down there:
11601: He’ll return to life again,
11602: Once he breathes this mythic air.                    7055
11603: Faust (As he touches the ground.)
11604: 
11605: Where is she?
11606: 
11607: Homunculus
11608: 
11609:                  We can’t say, I fear,
11610: But you can probably enquire here.
11611: Hurry now before it’s daylight,
11612: Go and search, from fire to fire:
11613: Who found his way to the Mothers’ side,        7060
11614: Won’t find this harder to survive.
11615: 
11616: Mephistopheles
11617: 
11618: On my own behalf too, I’m here:
11619: But I don’t know anything better
11620: Than each to seek, among the fires,
11621: The adventure he desires.                      7065
11622: Then, so that we can reunite,
11623: Little one, shine your ringing light.
11624: 
11625: Homunculus
11626: 
11627: It shines like this, and rings.
11628: 
11629: (The glass shines and rings out powerfully.)
11630: 
11631: Now off to new and wondrous things!
11632: 
11633: Faust (Alone.)
11634: 
11635: Where is she? – But no further answer seek…    7070
11636: If this is not the soil she trod,
11637: Nor the wave that bathed her foot,
11638: It is the air that spoke her speech.
11639: Here! By a miracle, on Hellenic land!
11640: I feel, the earth, too, where I stand:         7075
11641: A fresh power glows in me, the Sleeper,
11642: So I am Antaeus-like in nature.
11643: And I find the strangest things lie here,
11644: First let me search this Labyrinth of fire.
11645: 
11646: (He moves away.)
11647: (On the Upper Peneus)
11648: 
11649: Mephistopheles (Looking around.)
11650: 
11651: And as I wander through these fires,                            7080
11652: I feel myself a total stranger: in the event,
11653: They’re mostly naked, a shirt here and there:
11654: The Sphinx shameless, the Gryphon impudent:
11655: And what’s more, curly-haired and winged,
11656: Before, behind, in eyes, reflected things…                      7085
11657: Of course, at heart, indecency’s my ideal,
11658: But I find the Antique is a little too real.
11659: One should control all with a modern mind,
11660: Overlay it with fashions of assorted kinds….
11661: Repulsive people! Yet still I have to meet them,                7090
11662: And, as a new guest too, correctly greet them…
11663: Luck to you, fair ladies, and men, you wise grey ones!
11664: 
11665: A Gryphon (Snarling. For the gold-guarding Gryphons see Herodotus’
11666: Histories.)
11667: 
11668: Not Grey ones! Gryphons! – No one likes the name
11669: Of something grey. Every word rings
11670: With what conditioned it: its origins:                          7095
11671: Grey, grievous, grumpy, gruesome, gravely, grimly,
11672: Similarly harmonious etymologically,
11673: Disharmonise us.
11674: 
11675: Mephistopheles
11676: 
11677:                        And yet, without deviation,
11678: You like the gryp in your proud name of Gryphon.
11679: 
11680: The Gryphon (Snarling continuously.)
11681: 
11682: Naturally! The relationship’s tried and tested:                 7100
11683: It was often censured, but more often praised:
11684: One grips maidens, money, gold,
11685: To the gripper, Fortune’s never cold.
11686: Giant Ants
11687: 
11688: You spoke of gold: we’ve collected lots of it,
11689: In rocks and caves, secretly, we’ve crammed it:                     7105
11690: The Arimaspi, discovered it all, one day,
11691: They’re laughing now: they took it far away.
11692: 
11693: The Gryphon
11694: 
11695: We’ll soon make them confess.
11696: 
11697: The Arimaspi (For the Scythian race of the Arimaspi and their association
11698: with gold mining see Herodotus’ Histories)
11699: 
11700: But not on this night of public festival.
11701: By morning we’ll have spent it all.                                 7110
11702: This time at least we’ll achieve success.
11703: 
11704: Mephistopheles (Sitting among the Sphinxes.)
11705: 
11706: How free, and easy, I feel here,
11707: I understand you, one and all.
11708: 
11709: Sphinx
11710: 
11711: We breathe out spirit-tones, clear,
11712: That for you become substantial.                                    7115
11713: Now name yourself, so we can know your fame.
11714: 
11715: Mephistopheles
11716: 
11717: Men choose to saddle me with a host of names…
11718: Are there Britons here? They travel about so much,
11719: Looking for battlefields, and ruined walls,
11720: The dullest classical places, waterfalls:                           7120
11721: Here’s a site that’s worth all their fuss.
11722: They spoke of me too: in their Mysteries:
11723: And portrayed me there as Old Iniquity.
11724: A Sphinx
11725: 
11726: How so?
11727: 
11728: Mephistopheles
11729: 
11730:       I don’t know why that should be.
11731: 
11732: A Sphinx
11733: 
11734: Perhaps you’ve knowledge of the stars?                7125
11735: What do you think of the present hour?
11736: 
11737: Mephistopheles (Gazing upwards.)
11738: 
11739: Star glides by star, the horned moon shines bright,
11740: And I feel happy here, in this mournful site,
11741: I warm myself on a lion skin: your right.
11742: To have to take off, again: that would be hard:       7130
11743: Give us a riddle, or at least charades.
11744: 
11745: Sphinx
11746: 
11747: To express yourself, that would be a riddle.
11748: Try for once to solve your own inner muddle:
11749: ‘Needed by the good man and the sinful,
11750: To the first a breastplate in ascetic swordplay,      7135
11751: A wild friend for the other, to show the way,
11752: And both amusing Zeus with their display.’
11753: 
11754: The First Gryphon (Snarling.)
11755: 
11756: I don’t like him!
11757: 
11758: The Second Gryphon (Snarling more fiercely.)
11759: 
11760:                           What’s he after?
11761: 
11762: Both Gryphons
11763: The nasty thing, he’s not been heard of here!
11764: 
11765: Mephistopheles (Nastily)
11766: 
11767: Perhaps you think a guest’s nails can’t claw          7140
11768: Every bit as sharply as those talons of yours?
11769: Just try it, then!
11770: 
11771: A Sphinx (Gently.)
11772: 
11773:                         You’ll only stay until,
11774: You leave our company, yourself, as you will:
11775: In your own land everything worked for you,
11776: But this if I’m not wrong’s too much for you.         7145
11777: 
11778: Mephistopheles
11779: 
11780: Looked at above, you’re rather appetising,
11781: But lower down the creature’s somewhat frightening.
11782: 
11783: A Sphinx
11784: 
11785: False one, you’ll do bitter penance,
11786: These claws of ours are sound and good:
11787: You with your withered horse’s hoof,                  7150
11788: Aren’t comfortable in our presence.
11789: 
11790: (The Sirens start to sing, above them.)
11791: 
11792: What are those birds shaking
11793: The poplar branches by the stream?
11794: 
11795: A Sphinx
11796: 
11797: Take care! The song they’re making
11798: Conquered the best there’s ever been.                 7155
11799: The Sirens
11800: 
11801: Ah, why should you choose to live
11802: Amongst amazing ugliness!
11803: Listen, we flock to you, ah yes,
11804: With tuneful sounds, in excess,
11805: That Sirens ought to give.              7160
11806: 
11807: The Sphinxes (Mocking them.)
11808: 
11809: Make them fly down here to us!
11810: Their falcon-claws, so hideous,
11811: They’ve hidden in the leaves:
11812: They’ll fall on you, cruelly, you see
11813: If you choose to hear them sigh.        7165
11814: 
11815: The Sirens
11816: 
11817: Away with hate! Away with envy!
11818: We gather purest ecstasies,
11819: Scattered through the sky!
11820: On the earth, or on the sea,
11821: With the happiest gestures, we          7170
11822: Greet men who wander by.
11823: 
11824: Mephistopheles
11825: 
11826: This is news of the sweetest,
11827: Here from lyre and chest,
11828: One note twines round another.
11829: But this warbling’s lost on me:         7175
11830: It crawls into my ear, you see,
11831: Yet my heart feels nothing, here.
11832: 
11833: The Sphinxes
11834: 
11835: Don’t talk of hearts! That’s idle:
11836: A leather bag would do as well,
11837: To match that face you wear.            7180
11838: Faust (Approaching.)
11839: 
11840: Marvellous! Gazing’s enough for me,
11841: At grand repulsiveness, and solidity:
11842: I suspect I’ll find good fortune shortly:
11843: Where will this serious gazing take me?
11844: 
11845: (He points at the Sphinxes.)
11846: 
11847: Once Oedipus stood in front of them:          7185
11848: 
11849: (He points at the Sirens.)
11850: 
11851: Ulysses writhed in ropes for them:
11852: 
11853: (He points to the Ants.)
11854: 
11855: They gathered a mighty treasure.
11856: 
11857: (He points to the Gryphons.)
11858: 
11859: They guarded it in fullest measure.
11860: I feel new power flowing through me:
11861: Mighty these forms: of mighty memory.         7190
11862: 
11863: Mephistopheles
11864: 
11865: Once you’d have run from things like these,
11866: But now they look good to you:
11867: When a man seeks his beloved, he’s
11868: Ready to meet monsters too.
11869: 
11870: Faust (To the Sphinxes.)
11871: 
11872: You female forms, tell me then,               7195
11873: Have any of you seen Helen?
11874: The Sphinxes
11875: 
11876: None of us lasted till her day,
11877: Hercules the last did slay.
11878: You can ask Chiron, anyway:
11879: He gallops round in this spirit night:        7200
11880: When he stops for you, you might.
11881: 
11882: The Sirens
11883: 
11884: You will not fail at all!…
11885: How Ulysses lingered with us,
11886: Not hurrying scornfully by us,
11887: He’d many times recall:                       7205
11888: All will be shown you,
11889: If you make your journey to
11890: Our fields, in the green sea.
11891: 
11892: A Sphinx
11893: 
11894: Don’t let yourself be deceived.
11895: Instead of Ulysses self-bonded,               7210
11896: We bind with good advice. On!
11897: When you reach noble Chiron,
11898: You’ll find it’s as I promised.
11899: 
11900: (Faust wanders off.)
11901: 
11902: Mephistopheles (In a temper.)
11903: 
11904: What croaks by me on beating wing,
11905: So quick that one can’t see a thing.          7215
11906: And one behind the other, flying?
11907: Even a hunter would weary of these.
11908: 
11909: A Sphinx
11910: 
11911: That storm, like the winds of winter, here,
11912: Hercules’ arrows could scarce get near:
11913: They are the swift Stymphalides,              7220
11914: And their croaked greetings are well-meant,
11915: The vulture-beaked, and goose-webbed.
11916: They’d gladly appear in our place,
11917: As a closely-related race.
11918: 
11919: Mephistopheles (As if intimidated.)
11920: 
11921: Something else is having a hissing fit.        7225
11922: 
11923: Sphinx
11924: 
11925: Don’t be worried about those either!
11926: They’re the heads of the Lernaean Hydra,
11927: Lopped from the trunk, but think they’re it.
11928: But, what’s the matter, now then?
11929: Why all the restless movements?                7230
11930: Where are you going? He’s gone!…
11931: I see that Chorus over there, that one,
11932: Has turned your head. You’ll get nowhere,
11933: Go on: greet every sweet face there!
11934: They’re Lamiae, the lustful girls,             7235
11935: With smiling lips, impudent curls,
11936: The race of Satyrs all delight in:
11937: With them a cloven foot’s the very thing.
11938: 
11939: Mephistopheles
11940: 
11941: Will you stay here? So I can find you again.
11942: 
11943: Sphinx
11944: 
11945: Yes! Mix with the flighty rabble.              7240
11946: In Egypt, we were accustomed, you know,
11947: To rule for a thousand years or so.
11948: And if you respect our location,
11949: We’ll regulate the days of Moon and Sun.
11950: We’ll sit in front of the Pyramids,            7245
11951: To pass judgement on the nations:
11952: With changeless faces, there, amid
11953: War and peace, and inundations.
11954: (On the Lower Peneus.)
11955: 
11956: (The river-god, surrounded by nymphs and tributary streams.)
11957: 
11958: Peneus
11959: 
11960: Stir, you reed-beds, whispering, flowing!
11961: Sigh softly, slender rushes, bowing,                           7250
11962: Lightly, willow-bushes, rustling,
11963: Lisp, you poplar-branches trembling,
11964: Through the broken dream!…..
11965: Dreadful premonitions wake me,
11966: Secret quivering, now, shakes me,                              7255
11967: In my peaceful wandering stream.
11968: 
11969: Faust (Approaching the river.)
11970: 
11971: If I heard true, as I believe:
11972: From behind the tangled leaves
11973: Of these shrubs and branches,
11974: Came sounds of human voices.                                   7260
11975: Then the fount seemed to chatter,
11976: And the breeze filled with laughter.
11977: 
11978: The Nymphs (To Faust.)
11979: 
11980: Just to lie here, now,
11981: For you would be best,
11982: Reviving your wearied                                          7265
11983: Body with coolness,
11984: Enjoy here forever
11985: Your fugitive rest:
11986: Murmuring, trickling,
11987: We’ll whisper, and bless.                                      7270
11988: Faust
11989: 
11990: I’m awake! O let them linger there
11991: Those images without compare,
11992: As they reached my sight.
11993: I’m moved so marvellously!
11994: Is it dream? Or is it memory?               7275
11995: Once before, I knew this delight.
11996: The waters creep through the freshness,
11997: The softly swaying bushes’ thickness,
11998: Without rushing, barely trickling:
11999: A hundred founts from all sides press,      7280
12000: And gather to the purest brightness,
12001: Fill the pool’s shallow ring.
12002: Glowing limbs of young girls are
12003: Reflected by the liquid mirror,
12004: And added to the eye’s delight!             7285
12005: Companionably, bathing joyfully,
12006: Swimming boldly, wading shyly,
12007: Crying out, at last, in watery fight.
12008: This sight’s enough to renew
12009: My eyes with gazing at the view,            7290
12010: But ever wider vision strains.
12011: My glance cuts sharply through the cover,
12012: Rich foliage, green wealth, around her,
12013: Serves to hide the noble queen.
12014: 
12015: Marvellous! The swans approaching:          7295
12016: From the bays, come softly swimming,
12017: Majestically pure their movement.
12018: Floating calm, in sweet society,
12019: But how proudly, self-delightedly,
12020: Head and neck are lifted, bent…..           7300
12021: One shines out above all others,
12022: Boasting boldly of his favours,
12023: Sailing swiftly in their race:
12024: His ruffled plumage swelling,
12025: Wave-like, on the wave he’s stirring,       7305
12026: He hastens to the sacred place…
12027: The others swimming here and there,
12028: With their smooth shining feathers,
12029: Soon meet in fine contention,
12030: Drive away the frightened maidens,         7310
12031: Not thinking of their service, then
12032: But only of their own protection.
12033: 
12034: The Nymphs
12035: 
12036: Sisters, bend and set you ears
12037: To the river-banks’ green turf:
12038: If I hear rightly, coming near,            7315
12039: That’s the sound of hooves on earth.
12040: If I only knew who that message might
12041: Be bringing, swiftly, to the Night!
12042: 
12043: Faust
12044: 
12045: To me, the ground seems ringing, too
12046: Echoing to some swift stallion’s hoof.     7320
12047: There, gaze, my eyes!
12048: Good luck, is nigh,
12049: Will it come to me as well?
12050: O, wonder without parallel!
12051: A rider trots towards us, now,             7325
12052: Gifted, shines with spirit and power
12053: Grafted to a snow-white horse…
12054: I know him too, I can’t be wrong,
12055: It’s Philyra’s famous son! –
12056: Halt, Chiron! Halt! Hear my discourse…     7330
12057: 
12058: Chiron (The Centaur.)
12059: 
12060: What then? What is it?
12061: 
12062: Faust
12063: 
12064:                          Delay a moment!
12065: Chiron
12066: 
12067: I never rest.
12068: 
12069: Faust
12070:                 Well, take me with you, then!
12071: 
12072: Chiron
12073: 
12074: Mount! And I can question you, at leisure:
12075: Where are you going? You’re by the river,
12076: I’ll carry you through the flood, with pleasure.   7335
12077: 
12078: Faust (Mounting his back.)
12079: 
12080: Wherever you wish. My thanks forever…
12081: You, the great man, the noble teacher,
12082: Famed for educating the race of heroes,
12083: That splendid company of the Argonauts,
12084: And all who edified the Poets’ thoughts.           7340
12085: 
12086: Chiron
12087: 
12088: All that in its proper place!
12089: As Mentor, even Pallas wasn’t rated:
12090: In the end they do things their own way,
12091: As if they’d none of them been educated.
12092: 
12093: Faust
12094: 
12095: The doctor who can name the plants,                7345
12096: And roots, profoundly, understands:
12097: Who heals the sick, and soothes the wound,
12098: Here, strong in mind and body, have I found!
12099: Chiron
12100: 
12101: When a hero was injured near me.
12102: I gave the right assistance and advice:       7350
12103: But, at last, bequeathed my art, you see,
12104: To priests, and herb-gathering old wives.
12105: 
12106: Faust
12107: 
12108: You’ve a truly great man’s ways:
12109: He won’t hear a word of praise.
12110: He’ll modestly defer to us                    7355
12111: And act as if all were equals.
12112: 
12113: Chiron
12114: 
12115: You seem artful at those pretences,
12116: Which flatter common folk and princes.
12117: 
12118: Faust
12119: 
12120: But surely you’d confess today:
12121: You saw the greatest, of your age,            7360
12122: Among the noblest deeds, you trod,
12123: And lived life as a demi-god.
12124: Among those great heroic forms,
12125: Who was the finest of them all?
12126: 
12127: Chiron
12128: 
12129: Among the Argonauts, in my day,               7365
12130: Each was worthy, in his own way.
12131: And with the powers he inhaled,
12132: Knew enough when others failed.
12133: Castor and Pollux always conquered,
12134: When youth and beauty were honoured.          7370
12135: In determination, and swift help to others,
12136: First was Calais, and Zetes his brother,
12137: Thoughtful, clever, strong, well-advised,
12138: Jason conquered, woman-folk’s delight.
12139: Then Orpheus: gentle, always brooding,            7375
12140: Sounding the lyre, quite over-powering.
12141: Sharp-eyed Lynceus, by night and day,
12142: Steering the sacred ship past reef and bay…
12143: Let such dangers always be faced as brothers:
12144: If one achieves he’s praised by all the others.   7380
12145: 
12146: Faust
12147: 
12148: Of Hercules, you say nothing?
12149: 
12150: Chiron
12151: 
12152: Oh! Don’t rouse my yearning….
12153: Never noting how Phoebus
12154: Ares, or Hermes, were defined,
12155: With my own eyes I saw before us                  7385
12156: What all men praise as divine.
12157: He was born a king, no other,
12158: A splendid youth to gaze upon:
12159: Yielding to his elder brother,
12160: And the loveliest of women.                       7390
12161: Gaea’s never known a second,
12162: Nor Hebe led such on to heaven’s zone:
12163: In vain for him they sing the songs,
12164: In vain for him they carve the stone.
12165: 
12166: Faust
12167: 
12168: The sculptors never caught his form,              7395
12169: However many images they made.
12170: You’ve spoken of the loveliest man,
12171: Now speak about the loveliest maid!
12172: Chiron
12173: 
12174: What!…I won’t talk of woman’s beauty,
12175: It’s so often a frozen mask to me:                   7400
12176: I can only praise that nature, truly,
12177: Flowing freely, and cheerfully.
12178: Beauty’s delighted with itself:
12179: Grace makes it irresistible,
12180: Like Helen, whom I carried.                          7405
12181: 
12182: Faust
12183: 
12184: You carried her?
12185: 
12186: Chiron
12187: 
12188:                 Yes on this very back.
12189: 
12190: Faust
12191: 
12192: Was I not sufficiently aroused?
12193: Such a seat, now, will bring me luck!
12194: 
12195: Chiron
12196: 
12197: She gripped me by the mane, so,
12198: As you are doing.
12199: 
12200: Faust
12201: 
12202:              I’m vanquished, oh,                     7410
12203: Completely! Tell me, why here?
12204: She is my one and only desire!
12205: Carried her from where, to where?
12206: 
12207: Chiron
12208: 
12209: That’s easy to tell, since you enquire.
12210: At that time, the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux,       7415
12211: Freed their sister, Helen, from a nest of robbers.
12212: The robbers then, not used to being conquered,
12213: Regained their courage, and chased them onward.
12214: The sister and brothers’ hasty course was halted
12215: By all the swamps that lie below Eleusis:          7420
12216: The brothers waded: I swam over, swiftly:
12217: Then she sprang off, and, stroking gently
12218: My wet mane, caressed me, thanked me,
12219: Confident, sweetly clever were her ways.
12220: She was so charming! Youth, delighting Age!        7425
12221: 
12222: Faust
12223: 
12224: Only ten years old!…
12225: 
12226: Chiron
12227: 
12228:           The philologists deceive you,
12229: I see, while deceiving themselves too.
12230: It’s strange that with a mythological woman,
12231: Poets use her, at will, to draw our attention,
12232: She can never age, is never old,                   7430
12233: Cast in the same enticing mould,
12234: Seduced when young, in age delights:
12235: Enough, no age restricts a poet’s flights.
12236: 
12237: Faust
12238: 
12239: Then let her be as if no age has bound her!
12240: As Achilles on Pherae once found her,              7435
12241: Beyond all ages. What rare luck:
12242: In spite of every fate, to win her love!
12243: And shall I, by the strength of my yearning,
12244: Not draw that unique form towards me, living,
12245: That eternal being, equal to the divine,           7440
12246: Great yet tender: kind as she’s sublime.
12247: You saw her once: today I too have seen her,
12248: Lovely in her attraction: as lovely as desired.
12249: Now my soul and being is strongly tied:
12250: If I can’t win her, I shan’t survive.              7445
12251: Chiron
12252: 
12253: Ah, stranger! You’re enraptured like Mankind:
12254: Among us Spirits you seem maddened, blind.
12255: Yet now your fate is to be met with here:
12256: Though only for a moment, every year,
12257: I take the time to call on Manto, there,              7450
12258: Aesculapius’ daughter: in silent prayer
12259: Imploring her father to add to his fame,
12260: Enlighten, at last, each rash doctor’s brain,
12261: And persuade them never to deal death again…
12262: I like her best of all the crowd of Sibyls,           7455
12263: Free of grimaces, kind and generous:
12264: If you stay with her, she’s the power too,
12265: To heal you totally: with herbs and roots.
12266: 
12267: Faust
12268: 
12269: I don’t need healing: my mind is filled with power:
12270: There I’d become as base as others are.               7460
12271: 
12272: Chiron
12273: 
12274: Don’t scorn the healing of the noble fount!
12275: We’ve reached the place, so, quick, dismount!
12276: 
12277: Faust
12278: 
12279: Tell me, where, through pebbly water,
12280: In the gloomy night, you’ve brought us?
12281: 
12282: Chiron
12283: 
12284: Here Greece and Rome braved the fight,                7465
12285: Olympus to your left, Peneus on the right,
12286: The greatest empire lost here to the sand:
12287: A king flees: and citizens win the land.
12288: Gaze around! Famous Tempe is nearby,
12289: Eternal, there, under the moonlit sky.                7470
12290: Manto (Inside, dreaming.)
12291: 
12292: Horses’ hooves sound
12293: On sacred ground,
12294: Demi-gods are nigh us.
12295: 
12296: Chiron
12297: 
12298: Quite right!
12299: Just open your eyes!                         7475
12300: 
12301: Manto (Waking.)
12302: 
12303: Welcome! I see you don’t keep away.
12304: 
12305: Chiron
12306: 
12307: And your temple’s still here to stay!
12308: 
12309: Manto
12310: 
12311: You still gallop round, untiringly?
12312: 
12313: Chiron
12314: 
12315: And you, as ever, sit peacefully,
12316: While I enjoy circling round.                7480
12317: 
12318: Manto
12319: 
12320: I wait, and Time circles me I’ve found.
12321: And him?
12322: 
12323: Chiron
12324: 
12325:          The shadowy night
12326: Has whirled him to our sight.
12327: Helen he wants to win,
12328: Helen’s maddening him.                       7485
12329: And he doesn’t know where or how to begin:
12330: Above all he deserves the Aesculapian healing.
12331: 
12332: Manto
12333: 
12334: I like the ones who want impossible things.
12335: 
12336: (Chiron is already far off.)
12337: 
12338: Rash man, advance, here’s joy for you!
12339: This dark path leads to Persephone too.          7490
12340: Under Olympus’ hollow foot, stealing,
12341: She listens for secret, forbidden greeting.
12342: I smuggled Orpheus down here once before:
12343: Use your chance better! Quick! Be sure!
12344: 
12345: (They descend.)
12346: Part II Act II Scene IV: On The Upper Peneus Again
12347: 
12348: The Sirens
12349: 
12350: Plunge now in Peneus’ flood!                         7495
12351: Here you can delight in swimming,
12352: Song on song too, harmonising,
12353: Does unlucky people good.
12354: There’s no healing without water!
12355: With the shining crowd run we                        7500
12356: Quick, to the Aegean Sea,
12357: Where every joy’s on offer.
12358: 
12359: (An Earthquake.)
12360: 
12361: The foaming wave sweeps wider,
12362: Flowing in its bed no longer:
12363: Earth shakes and waters roar,                        7505
12364: Stony banks split once more.
12365: We fly on! Come, one and all!
12366: We’ll not profit from this at all.
12367: On! Each noble, happy guest,
12368: To the ocean’s cheerful zest,                        7510
12369: Gleaming, where the trembling waves
12370: Lightly heaving, wash the bays:
12371: Where the moon’s reflected light,
12372: Wets with heaven’s dew, at night.
12373: There, a freely flowing life,                        7515
12374: Here, an earthquake’s fearful strife:
12375: Every clever one, hasten on!
12376: This place is a hideous one.
12377: Seismos (Growling and jolting in the deep.)
12378: 
12379: Push again, with power,
12380: With your shoulders, tower!                   7520
12381: So the world above is ours,
12382: Where all must yield to us.
12383: 
12384: The Sphinxes
12385: 
12386: What a horrid shuddering,
12387: Ugly, hideous juddering!
12388: What a quivering and swaying,                 7525
12389: Back and forwards, playing!
12390: What an intolerable fuss!
12391: But we’ll not lose our place,
12392: Even if all hell shakes.
12393: Now a dome is lifted,                         7530
12394: Wonderful. He’s gifted
12395: It to us, the ancient one,
12396: Delos’ isle was his creation,
12397: Driven from out the wave,
12398: To bring Latona aid.                          7535
12399: He with striving, pushing, pressing,
12400: Arms straight, and shoulders bending,
12401: Like an Atlas in his action,
12402: Lifts rock and earth, in motion,
12403: Shingle, gravel, sand: the floors             7540
12404: All along our peaceful shores.
12405: Rips our vale’s quiet surface up,
12406: Crosswise, with a single cut:
12407: Fiercely, and unwearied,
12408: A colossal caryatid,                          7545
12409: Bears a fearsome weight of boulders,
12410: Still buried, downwards to his shoulders:
12411: But he’ll come no further, now,
12412: The Sphinxes’ place is here, we vow.
12413: Seismos
12414: 
12415: I myself achieved all this,                7550
12416: Man should admit it, finally:
12417: If I’d not jolted and shaken it,
12418: How could the world be so lovely? –
12419: How could your peaks stand so high,
12420: In the pure and splendid blue,             7555
12421: If I’d not pushed them to the sky,
12422: Picturesque and charming too?
12423: Then, thinking of my high ancestry,
12424: Night and Chaos, I behaved badly,
12425: And, a company of Titans, we               7560
12426: With Pelion and Ossa played madly,
12427: Romping round in youthful glee,
12428: Till, we tired of it, at last,
12429: And set both mountains, wickedly,
12430: On Parnassus, as a double hat….            7565
12431: There, now, Apollo’s sweet retreat,
12432: With the happy band of Muses.
12433: And Jupiter, thunderbolts complete:
12434: I even raised the high seat he uses.
12435: So now with monstrous striving             7570
12436: I’ve pushed this upwards, from the deep,
12437: And call, aloud, to their new being,
12438: The joyful dwellers of the steep.
12439: 
12440: The Sphinxes
12441: 
12442: One would think long ago,
12443: This was lifted to the sky,                7575
12444: Had we not seen from down below,
12445: How it wormed its way on high.
12446: A bushy forest covers it,
12447: And rock on rock is piled around:
12448: Sphinxes don’t care about it,              7580
12449: It won’t disturb our sacred ground.
12450: The Gryphons
12451: 
12452: Gold in leaves, and gold in spangles,
12453: Through the cracks, see, it tremble.
12454: Don’t you rob us of our treasure,
12455: Ants, come, gather it together!         7585
12456: 
12457: Chorus of Ants
12458: 
12459: As this the giant ones
12460: Threw to the sky,
12461: You restless-footed ones,
12462: Quick, climb it on high!
12463: Rapidly in and out!                     7590
12464: In cracks like these,
12465: Every crumb about’s
12466: Worth you can seize.
12467: You must uncover
12468: Even the slightest,                     7595
12469: In every corner
12470: Quick as the brightest.
12471: You must be everywhere,
12472: Swarming around: then,
12473: Only bring gold here!                   7600
12474: Forget the mountain.
12475: 
12476: The Gryphons
12477: 
12478: Come! Come! Heap the gold!
12479: With our claws, we’ll keep hold:
12480: They are the best locks yet:
12481: Great treasures they protect.           7605
12482: 
12483: The Pygmies (Classical Dwarves.)
12484: 
12485: We’ve acquired some room,
12486: How, it isn’t clear.
12487: Don’t ask where we’re from:
12488: The main thing is we’re here!
12489: Life is cheerfully suited               7610
12490: To every sort of land:
12491: Where a rock is lifted,
12492: Dwarves are there, on hand.
12493: Men and maids, quick and busy,
12494: Exemplary, every pair:              7615
12495: In Paradise, once, maybe,
12496: A similar race lived there.
12497: But the best is here we find,
12498: Thankfully our fate is blessed:
12499: Mother Earth is always kind,        7620
12500: In the East as in the West.
12501: 
12502: The Dactyls (Little Ironworkers.)
12503: 
12504: If she can bring to light
12505: The Little Ones in a night,
12506: The Littlest Ones, she can make
12507: And each will still find a mate.    7625
12508: 
12509: The Pygmy-Elders
12510: 
12511: Hurry: make space:
12512: A convenient place!
12513: Quickly, to work!
12514: Strength, never shirk!
12515: While we’re in peace,               7630
12516: Our smithy increase,
12517: To furnish the horde
12518: With armour and sword.
12519: All you ant-forms,
12520: Moving in swarms,                   7635
12521: Bring us the ore!
12522: And all you Dactyls,
12523: So many, so little,
12524: You are commanded
12525: To bring us the wood!               7640
12526: Heap it up higher,
12527: Secretive fire,
12528: Fetch coals as you should.
12529: The Pygmy Generalissimo
12530: 
12531: Look lively, though,
12532: With arrow and bow!                      7645
12533: Shoot me the herons
12534: Out in the ponds,
12535: Countless they’re nests,
12536: Proud are their breasts,
12537: Shoot them, together,                    7650
12538: All in one blow!
12539: So we can show
12540: Helmets with feathers.
12541: 
12542: Ants and Dactyls
12543: 
12544: Who now can save us!
12545: We bring the iron                        7655
12546: They forge the fetters.
12547: It won’t be soon
12548: This thing will end,
12549: Meanwhile we bend.
12550: 
12551: The Cranes of Ibycus
12552: 
12553: Cries of murdered, calls of dying!       7660
12554: Fearful fluttering and flying!
12555: Such deep moans, and such groans
12556: Carry to our airy zones!
12557: All already slaughtered,
12558: Blood is reddening the water,            7665
12559: Misshapen dwarfish passions,
12560: Steal the herons’ noblest gems.
12561: Now they’re waving on their helmets:
12562: Those fat-bellied bow-legged serpents.
12563: You our armies’ members,                 7670
12564: Files of ocean-wanderers,
12565: You we call to vengeance,
12566: To kin-related business.
12567: No one spare his strength or blood!
12568: Show hatred always to that brood!        7675
12569: (They disperse, croaking.)
12570: 
12571: Mephistopheles (On the plain.)
12572: 
12573: Northern witches were easily controlled,
12574: But over foreign spirits I’ve no hold.
12575: The Blocksberg’s a most convenient locale,
12576: Wherever you are, you’ll find yourself there still.
12577: Dame Ilse watches for us, from her tall stone,        7680
12578: And Heinrich’s still awake on his high throne,
12579: At Elend, the Snorers snore away,
12580: All’s done for a thousand years and a day.
12581: Who knows here if, where he sits, you see,
12582: The Earth won’t swell up beneath his feet?….          7685
12583: I wander happily through a level valley,
12584: And in a moment there, thrown up behind me,
12585: A mountain, true it’s hardly to be called one,
12586: But high enough to hide the Sphinxes’ home –
12587: Still, the valley breeds many a fire here,            7690
12588: And so illuminates this mad affair….
12589: The magic sparks of that charming chorus.
12590: Still enticing, vanishing, hover near us.
12591: Gently now! All too used to nibbling,
12592: Wherever we are, we find ourselves snatching.         7695
12593: 
12594: The Lamiae (Drawing Mephistopheles after them.)
12595: 
12596: Faster, and faster!
12597: And ever further!
12598: Then hover again,
12599: Chattering, staying.
12600: It’s such a pleasure,                                 7700
12601: To make the old sinner,
12602: Pursue us, at whim,
12603: Doing hard penance.
12604: See, with his lame stance,
12605: He hobbles forwards,                                  7705
12606: He stumbles onwards:
12607: Trailing his leg, mind:
12608: As we flee from him
12609: He follows behind!
12610: 
12611: Mephistopheles (Standing still.)
12612: 
12613: Cursed fate! Cheated every which way!        7710
12614: Since Adam, seduced and led astray!
12615: We grow old, but who grows wise?
12616: Now, I’m tormented to the skies!
12617: We know they’re a wholly useless sex,
12618: With laced-in bodies, and painted looks.     7715
12619: No healthy response at all, at bottom,
12620: Wherever you grip, their limbs are rotten.
12621: We know, we see, we grasp their ways,
12622: But still we dance when woman plays!
12623: 
12624: The Lamiae (Pausing.)
12625: 
12626: Stop! He thinks: pauses: stays too:          7720
12627: Return, then, lest he should escape you!
12628: 
12629: Mephistopheles (Striding forwards.)
12630: 
12631: On, then! And let no indecision
12632: Grip my flesh, some foolish cavil:
12633: Since if there were no witches given,
12634: Who the devil’d want to be a devil!          7725
12635: 
12636: The Lamiae (Very graciously.)
12637: 
12638: We are circling round the hero!
12639: Let love, in his heart, be sure to
12640: Choose one of us for certain though.
12641: 
12642: Mephistopheles
12643: 
12644: True, in this uncertain shimmer,
12645: You seem pretty girls together,              7730
12646: I’d like not to scorn you so.
12647: Empusa (The demon. Pressing forward.)
12648: 
12649: Nor me! I’m the very thing,
12650: Let me join your following.
12651: 
12652: The Lamiae
12653: 
12654: She’s one too many in our crowd,
12655: She’ll spoil our game if she’s allowed.     7735
12656: 
12657: Empusa (To Mephistopheles.)
12658: 
12659: Greetings from Empusa, to you,
12660: Your cousin, with the ass’s hoof!
12661: You’ve only a horse’s hoof, it’s true,
12662: Yet, cousin, all the best to you!
12663: 
12664: Mephistopheles
12665: 
12666: I thought there were only strangers here,   7740
12667: Sadly, now, relatives appear:
12668: It’s the old story: in their dozens,
12669: From Hartz to Hellas, always cousins!
12670: 
12671: Empusa
12672: 
12673: I act quickly with decision,
12674: I can alter to your vision:                 7745
12675: But to honour you today
12676: My ass’s head I display.
12677: 
12678: Mephistopheles
12679: 
12680: I see great things are signified,
12681: By the relationship implied:
12682: Be that as it may, yet I,                   7750
12683: The ass’s head will still deny.
12684: The Lamiae
12685: 
12686: That ugly thing gives the frights,
12687: To all that’s lovely and delights:
12688: The lovely and delightful before,
12689: When she arrives, are so no more!         7755
12690: 
12691: Mephistopheles
12692: 
12693: These cousins too, so soft and slender,
12694: Are all suspicious, all that gender:
12695: And beneath their cheeks, those roses,
12696: There too, I fear, are metamorphoses.
12697: 
12698: The Lamiae
12699: 
12700: Try us then! We’re many.                  7760
12701: Grasp! And if you’re lucky,
12702: Secure the finest prize.
12703: What was all that lusting for?
12704: You’re a miserable suitor,
12705: Strutting, boasting of your size! –       7765
12706: Now he’s mixing with our crowd:
12707: Drop your masks: you’re allowed:
12708: And bare your being to his eyes.
12709: 
12710: Mephistopheles
12711: 
12712: I’ve chosen the loveliest one…
12713: 
12714: (Clasping her.)
12715: 
12716: Oh! What a skinny broom!                  7770
12717: 
12718: (Clasping another.)
12719: 
12720: And this one?…Wizened looks!
12721: The Lamiae
12722: 
12723: You’re worth better? Not in our books.
12724: 
12725: Mephistopheles
12726: 
12727: That little one might suit my plans…
12728: A lizard gliding through my hands!
12729: And snakelike are her slippery tresses.        7775
12730: I try the tall one to compare…
12731: I grip a thyrsus without hair,
12732: A pinecone, for a head, impresses!
12733: What next?….A fat one, see,
12734: Perhaps she’ll enliven me:                     7780
12735: Let’s risk it, then! Here she is!
12736: So puffy, flabby, in the East
12737: There they’d prize her looks, at least…
12738: But, oh! The puff-ball’s split!
12739: 
12740: The Lamiae
12741: 
12742: Scatter widely, swaying, floating,             7785
12743: Surround him in dark flight, like lightning,
12744: The trespassing witch’s son!
12745: Circles, terrifying, winging!
12746: Bat-like in a silent flickering!
12747: He’ll be grateful when we’ve done.             7790
12748: 
12749: Mephistopheles (Shaking himself.)
12750: 
12751: I’m no cleverer it seems, at all:
12752: Here’s absurd, and so’s the north,
12753: Here and there, the spirits tricky,
12754: Poetry and people tacky.
12755: Here too it’s masquerade, I find:              7795
12756: As everywhere, the dance of mind.
12757: I grasped a lovely masked procession,
12758: And caught things from a horror show…
12759: I’d gladly settle for a false impression,
12760: If it would last a little longer, though.      7800
12761: (He loses his way among the rocks.)
12762: 
12763: Where am I now? Where will it wander?
12764: There was a path, now it’s a horror.
12765: I got here by smooth and level ways,
12766: And now the scree prevents escape.
12767: I clamber up and down in vain,                        7805
12768: How shall I find the Sphinx again?
12769: I’ve never known anything like it, quite,
12770: A mountain range in a single night!
12771: I call it a lively witches’ ride,
12772: They’ve brought the Blocksberg, beside.               7810
12773: 
12774: An Oread (A mountain nymph, from the natural rock.)
12775: 
12776: Climb up here! My range is old,
12777: In primeval forms the peaks unfold.
12778: Respect the steep and rocky stair,
12779: Pindus’ last slopes stretch there!
12780: Unshakeable, once I stood, as now,                    7815
12781: When Pompey fled across my brow.
12782: Beside me, illusion’s stones will go,
12783: As soon as ever the cock shall crow.
12784: I often see such fables thrown on high,
12785: And suddenly sink back again and die.                 7820
12786: 
12787: Mephistopheles
12788: 
12789: Honour to you, you noble length,
12790: Garlanded high with oaken strength!
12791: The clearest moonlight never weaves
12792: Through the darkness of your leaves –
12793: I see a light, with parting glow,                     7825
12794: Through the silent bushes go.
12795: How all things come together!
12796: Homunculus it is who’s there!
12797: Which way now, little fellow?
12798: Homunculus
12799: 
12800: I flit about from hill to hollow                7830
12801: And, in the truest sense, I’d gladly ‘be’,
12802: I’m so impatient, now, to smash the glass:
12803: Only, so far, given what I can see,
12804: I wouldn’t want to do it in this pass.
12805: But in confidence I confess I was               7835
12806: On the trail of two philosophers,
12807: All I heard them say was: Nature, Nature!
12808: I’ll not part from them for anything,
12809: They must know about earthly being:
12810: And in the end I’ll find out, too,              7840
12811: The cleverest place to travel to.
12812: 
12813: Mephistopheles
12814: 
12815: Well, do it on your own behalf, here.
12816: Where the spirits all find their place,
12817: The Philosopher can show his face.
12818: To please you with his art and favour,          7845
12819: He’ll make you a dozen, any flavour.
12820: You’ll have no intellect, unless you err.
12821: If you want to ‘be’, make it your own affair!
12822: 
12823: Homunculus
12824: 
12825: Good advice too is not to be disdained.
12826: 
12827: Mephistopheles
12828: 
12829: Then off with you! I’ll look around again.      7850
12830: 
12831: (They part.)
12832: Anaxagoras (To Thales.)
12833: 
12834: The stubborn mind will never ever bend:
12835: What more do you need to be enlightened?
12836: 
12837: Thales
12838: 
12839: The waves will gladly bow to every wind,
12840: Yet far from the jagged cliffs they’ll end.
12841: 
12842: Anaxagoras
12843: 
12844: This cliff came about by fiery vapours.        7855
12845: 
12846: Thales
12847: 
12848: By moisture living things were created.
12849: 
12850: Homunculus (Between the two.)
12851: 
12852: Let me walk beside you, please.
12853: I myself desire to ‘be’!
12854: 
12855: Anaxagoras
12856: 
12857: Have you, O Thales, in a single night
12858: Brought a mount, from mud, to light?           7860
12859: 
12860: Thales
12861: 
12862: Never has nature in her living flow,
12863: Been bound to day, night, and hours, though.
12864: She creates every form by rule,
12865: At her greatest, force is never her tool.
12866: Anaxagoras
12867: 
12868: Here it was! Furious Plutonic fire,                7865
12869: Monstrous Aeolian vapours thrown higher,
12870: Broke through the ancient earth’s smooth crust,
12871: And raised the new mount with a swift up-thrust.
12872: 
12873: Thales
12874: 
12875: What more will come of it?
12876: It’s there, that’s fine: let it sit.               7870
12877: One loses time in remonstrance,
12878: And only leads the patient folk a dance.
12879: 
12880: Anaxagoras
12881: 
12882: The Mount quickly filled with Myrmidons,
12883: Living in the rocky clefts and caverns:
12884: Pygmies, ants and fingerlings,                     7875
12885: And other active little things.
12886: 
12887: (To Homunculus.)
12888: 
12889: You’ve not striven hard for greatness,
12890: Lived hermit-like, in narrowness:
12891: If you can accustom yourself to power,
12892: I’ll crown you their king, in an hour.             7880
12893: 
12894: Homunculus
12895: 
12896: What does Thales say?
12897: 
12898: Thales
12899: 
12900:                    It’s not my recommendation:
12901: With small means, you’ll only do small actions:
12902: With great means, the small achieve great ones.
12903: Look there! A dark cloud, see, the cranes come!
12904: So the excitable crowd will threaten,              7885
12905: And they would threaten the king so.
12906: With sharpened beak, and grasping claw,
12907: They tread the small ones to the floor:
12908: Fate falls like lightning on those below.
12909: It was a crime to kill the herons,                  7890
12910: Caught on their quiet and peaceful ponds.
12911: But that rain of arrowed slaughter,
12912: Brings cruel and bloody vengeance after,
12913: Summons the anger of their kin above,
12914: To spill the Pygmies’ guilty blood.                 7895
12915: What need for helmets, shields and spears?
12916: What use the dwarves’ heron-feather?
12917: How Dactyls and Ants hide together!
12918: The army wavers, flies, and disappears.
12919: 
12920: Anaxagoras (After a moment, solemnly.)
12921: 
12922: Till now I’ve praised the subterranean powers,      7900
12923: But turn, in this case, to higher ones than ours…
12924: You! Above, always evergreen,
12925: Triple-named, triply to be seen,
12926: I cry to you, by my people’s woe,
12927: Diana, Luna, Hecate, so!                            7905
12928: You, in deepest thought, the heartening,
12929: You power profound, calmly shining,
12930: Reveal your dark side’s fearful shower,
12931: Without spells, show your ancient power!
12932: 
12933: (A pause.)
12934: 
12935: Am I heard so swiftly?                              7910
12936: Has my cry
12937: To the deep sky
12938: Stirred Nature’s ranks so quickly?
12939: Already, greater, greater, nearing,
12940: The Goddess’ orbed throne appearing,                7915
12941: Monstrous, fearful to the sight!
12942: With fires that redden in the night…
12943: No closer, threatening disc of power!
12944: You’ll straight destroy us: sea and shore!
12945: So it was true, the Thessalian women,               7920
12946: Trusted with wicked magic runes,
12947: Enchanted you from your circling path,
12948: Wrested evil things from you, in wrath?…
12949: The bright shield now darkens,
12950: Suddenly splits: flashes, sparkles!         7925
12951: What a hissing! What a drumming!
12952: Thunder, wind, and rain are coming! –
12953: Humbled, on the steps of your throne! –
12954: Forgive me! I brought this on, alone.
12955: 
12956: (He throws himself on his face.)
12957: 
12958: Thales
12959: 
12960: What has this man not heard and seen!       7930
12961: I’m not sure what it was that’s been,
12962: I’m not sensitive to it like him, I find.
12963: We’d confess, these are crazy times,
12964: The Moon is quivering quite gently,
12965: In her place, though, just as formerly.     7935
12966: 
12967: Homunculus
12968: 
12969: Look there, at the Pygmies seat!
12970: The mount was round, now it’s a peak.
12971: I felt the monstrous recoil’s thunder,
12972: A rock fell from the Moon up yonder:
12973: All alike, without asking too,              7940
12974: Friend and foe it squashed and slew.
12975: I have to praise powers like those,
12976: All creation in a single night,
12977: Alike up there as down below,
12978: Bringing a mountain-heap to light.          7945
12979: Thales
12980: 
12981: Peace! It was just an imaginary sight.
12982: So farewell to that ugly brood!
12983: You didn’t become king, that’s good.
12984: Off now to the sea-festival, joy-blessed,
12985: Where they’ll honour a marvellous guest.          7950
12986: 
12987: (They exit.)
12988: 
12989: Mephistopheles (Climbing up the opposite side.)
12990: 
12991: I’ll have to climb through these steep rocks,
12992: Through the roots of ancient oaks!
12993: In my Hartz range, the smell of resin
12994: Has a hint of pitch, almost as pleasant
12995: As sulphur…but here, among the Greeks,            7955
12996: There’s not a sniff, wherever one seeks:
12997: But I’m still rather curious to know
12998: How they make hellfire and brimstone glow.
12999: 
13000: A Dryad (A wood nymph.)
13001: 
13002: In your own land, you’re naturally adept,
13003: Abroad, you don’t know enough as yet.             7960
13004: You shouldn’t think about home, here
13005: With these ancient oak trees to revere.
13006: 
13007: Mephistopheles
13008: 
13009: One thinks of all one’s left: besides,
13010: What one’s used to is paradise.
13011: But tell me what’s in that cave                   7965
13012: Dimly crouching, a triple shape?
13013: 
13014: The Dryad
13015: 
13016: Daughters of Phorkyas! Enter the place,
13017: And speak to them, if you’re not afraid.
13018: Mephistopheles
13019: 
13020: Why not! – I’ll look, and I’m amazed!
13021: Proud as I am, I must confess, though,               7970
13022: I’ve never seen the likes of those,
13023: They’re as foul as Ugliness any day….
13024: How can one find deadly sin
13025: Ugly at all when one has seen
13026: This triple monstrosity?                             7975
13027: We wouldn’t let them cross the sill
13028: Of the worst chamber of our hell.
13029: But here, in the land of beauty, all things Greek,
13030: Are famous now because they’re so antique…
13031: They seem to scent my presence: stirring,            7980
13032: Like vampire bats, squeaking, twittering.
13033: 
13034: The Phorkyads (The Three Graeae)
13035: 
13036: Give me the eye, Sisters, so I can find
13037: Who’s wandering so near our shrine.
13038: 
13039: Mephistopheles
13040: 
13041: Most Revered! Allow me near,
13042: To receive a triple blessing here.                   7985
13043: I come, as yet unknown it’s true,
13044: But distantly related, I think, to you.
13045: I’ve already seen the elder gods,
13046: Bowed low before Rhea and Ops:
13047: I even saw the Fates, your sisters,                  7990
13048: Yesterday, or the day before:
13049: But I’ve never seen the likes of you.
13050: I’m silenced now, and delighted too.
13051: 
13052: The Phorkyads
13053: 
13054: This spirit seems to have some sense.
13055: Mephistopheles
13056: 
13057: I’m amazed no poet’s had the intelligence             7995
13058: To sing of you. Tell me, how can that be?
13059: I’ve never seen you properly painted:
13060: The chisel should only try to carve you,
13061: Not the likes of Pallas, Venus, Juno.
13062: 
13063: The Phorkyads
13064: 
13065: Deep in solitude and stillest night,                  8000
13066: No one ever thought to show us three aright.
13067: 
13068: Mephistopheles
13069: 
13070: How could they? Here, concealed from view.
13071: You can’t see anyone: and they can’t see you.
13072: You need to achieve a suitable place,
13073: Where art and splendour share the space,              8005
13074: Where every day, as walking, living heroes,
13075: With giant steps, each block of marble goes.
13076: Where –
13077: 
13078: The Phorkyads
13079: 
13080:          Be silent, and don’t tempt us to roam!
13081: What use would it be to us, to be better known?
13082: Born in the night, and related to the night,          8010
13083: To ourselves, almost: to others quite out of sight.
13084: 
13085: Mephistopheles
13086: 
13087: In that case, there’s little more to say:
13088: One can oneself to others still betray.
13089: One eye’s enough for three, one tooth as well:
13090: Then it should be mythically possible,                8015
13091: To contain three beings in two,
13092: And leave me the third form, too.
13093: For a little while.
13094: A Phorkyad
13095: 
13096:       What do you think? Shall we try?
13097: 
13098: The Others
13099: 
13100: Let’s! – But without the tooth and eye.
13101: 
13102: Mephistopheles
13103: 
13104: Now you’ve denied me the best features of all:   8020
13105: How can I show your strict and perfect form?
13106: 
13107: A Phorkyad
13108: 
13109: Shut one eye, that’s easy to do,
13110: Let one greedy tooth show too,
13111: In profile you’ll at once achieve
13112: A sisterly likeness, to deceive.                 8025
13113: 
13114: Mephistopheles
13115: 
13116: Many thanks! Done!
13117: 
13118: The Phorkyads
13119: 
13120:                    Done!
13121: 
13122: Mephistopheles (As a Phorkyad, in profile.)
13123: 
13124:             Already I’m one,
13125: Of Chaos’s well-beloved sons!
13126: 
13127: The Phorkyads
13128: 
13129: We’re Chaos’s daughters, of undisputed right.
13130: 
13131: Mephistopheles
13132: 
13133: O shame, now I’ll be called a hermaphrodite.
13134: The Phorkyads
13135: 
13136: What a beauty in our sisterly trio!         8030
13137: We’ve two eyes, and two teeth now.
13138: 
13139: Mephistopheles
13140: 
13141: I’ll hide myself from every eye, as well,
13142: And frighten devils in the lakes of Hell.
13143: 
13144: (He exits.)
13145: Part II Act II Scene V: Rocky Coves in the Aegean Sea
13146:

13148: 
13149: The Sirens (Lying on the cliffs round about, playing flutes and singing.)
13150: 
13151: Though the Thessalian witch-women
13152: Wickedly, dragged you down to them,                                    8035
13153: With their horrors, long ago, in the dark,
13154: Look quietly down, now, from the arc
13155: Of night, on waves of glittering sparks:
13156: Mildly flashing, bright crowds, these:
13157: Shine now upon the swelling seas,                                      8040
13158: Which raise themselves from the deep!
13159: We’re sworn to serve you, thus,
13160: Sweet Luna, show grace to us.
13161: 
13162: The Nereids and Tritons (As marvels of the deep.)
13163: 
13164: Sound out loud, with clearer tones,
13165: Ringing through the sea’s wide zones:                                  8045
13166: Call the peoples of the deep!
13167: Before the storm’s ravening face,
13168: We sank to the stillest place,
13169: Now we’re drawn, by singing, sweet.
13170: See, how we’ve adorned ourselves,                                      8050
13171: In our great delight, as well,
13172: With our crowns, so nobly gemmed,
13173: And our belts with spangles hemmed!
13174: These spoils, now, before you, we lay,
13175: Treasures, shipwrecked here, and swallowed,                            8055
13176: Your enticing songs they followed,
13177: You the daemons of our bay.
13178: 
13179: The Sirens
13180: 
13181: We know well, in ocean freshness,
13182: Fishes play in slippery smoothness,
13183: Flickering lives, devoid of pain:                                      8060
13184: Yet you festive crowds that stray
13185: We would rather find today,
13186: That you’re more than fish, again.
13187: 
13188: The Nereids and Tritons
13189: 
13190: Before we came to meet you,
13191: We were thinking of that too:                 8065
13192: Speed away now, sisters: brothers!
13193: It only needs the slightest journey,
13194: For most effective proof that we,
13195: Certainly, are more than fishes.
13196: 
13197: (They swim off.)
13198: 
13199: The Sirens
13200: 
13201: They’ve vanished in a moment!                 8070
13202: To Samothrace they’re bent,
13203: Gone, with a favourable breeze.
13204: What is it they think they’ll see,
13205: In the realm of the noble Cabiri?
13206: They’re gods! But wondrously strange,         8075
13207: Always causing their forms to change,
13208: Never knowing what they might be.
13209: Stay at your clear height,
13210: Sweet Luna, graceful light,
13211: So we’ll remain nocturnal,                    8080
13212: Not chased by the diurnal!
13213: 
13214: Thales (On the shore, to Homunculus.)
13215: 
13216: I’d gladly lead you to old Nereus:
13217: His home’s not far away and cavernous,
13218: But his head, it’s of the very stubbornest,
13219: He’s a sour-top, and quite the nastiest.      8085
13220: The whole human race can’t satisfy
13221: Him, the grumbler, and needn’t try.
13222: Yet to him the future is revealed,
13223: And so all show respect, and yield
13224: Him honour in his high position:              8090
13225: He’s done quite well by many a one.
13226: 
13227: Homunculus
13228: 
13229: Then let’s try him, and hurry on!
13230: My glass and flame won’t fail our mission.
13231: 
13232: Nereus (The sea-god.)
13233: 
13234: Are those human voices, in my ear?
13235: How quickly my deepest anger stirs!                 8095
13236: Forms, reaching for the gods, in their endeavour,
13237: Yet condemned to be themselves, forever.
13238: In ancient times I had heavenly rest,
13239: Yet drove myself to act well to the best:
13240: And then, when I’d finished what I’d done,          8100
13241: It was quite clear that nothing had been won.
13242: 
13243: Thales
13244: 
13245: And yet, Old Man of the Sea, we trust you:
13246: You’re the Wise: so don’t drive us from you!
13247: See this flame, he’s almost human, really,
13248: He yields himself to your advice, completely.       8105
13249: 
13250: Nereus
13251: 
13252: What advice! Has Mankind valued my advice?
13253: A wise word’s frozen in a stubborn ear.
13254: No matter how often some harsh action strikes,
13255: People remain as self-willed as before.
13256: I warned Paris himself, in a fatherly way,          8110
13257: Before the foreign girl tempted him to stray.
13258: He stood bravely on the shore of Greece,
13259: And I told him what my Spirit could see:
13260: The smoke-filled air, the streaming blood,
13261: Glowing timbers, slaughter’s flood,                 8115
13262: Troy’s day of judgement, caught in verse,
13263: Its horrors known for ten thousand years.
13264: The old man’s words seemed idle to the young,
13265: He followed his need, and Ilium was gone –
13266: A bloody corpse, frozen with ancient pain,           8120
13267: For Pindus’ eagles, a literary gain.
13268: Ulysses too! Didn’t I tell him about
13269: Circe’s wiles, that Cyclopean lout?
13270: The indecision in his own shallow mind,
13271: And all of it! What benefit did he find?             8125
13272: Till, late indeed, the ocean favoured him more,
13273: And brought him, wave-tossed, to a friendly shore.
13274: 
13275: Thales
13276: 
13277: Such behaviour brings the wise man pain,
13278: Yet the good will chance it all again.
13279: An ounce of thanks will still please them deeply,    8130
13280: Outweighing tons of ingratitude completely.
13281: And it’s nothing slight we ask of you:
13282: The boy here wants to exist, and wisely too.
13283: 
13284: Nereus
13285: 
13286: Don’t ruin such a rare mood as this!
13287: Greater needs await me, today, than his:             8135
13288: I’ve summoned all my daughters here to me,
13289: The Dorides, the Graces of the Sea.
13290: Neither Olympus, nor your lands can show
13291: Such lovely forms, with such delicate flow,
13292: They fling themselves, with graceful actions,        8140
13293: From sea-horses to Neptune’s stallions,
13294: Blending so sensitively with the element,
13295: That they seem made of foam, to all intent.
13296: In a play of colours, on Venus’ chariot shell,
13297: Galatea, the loveliest, comes to me, as well,        8145
13298: Who, since Cypris turned away from us,
13299: Rules as the new divinity of Paphos.
13300: And so, heiress, for ages now, the sweet one,
13301: Holds town, and temple, chariot and throne.
13302: Away! It’s time for a father’s enjoyments,           8150
13303: Hearts without hate, lips without judgements.
13304: Away, to Proteus! Ask that wondrous man:
13305: How man exists, and changes, if he can.
13306: 
13307: (He vanishes into the sea.)
13308: 
13309: Thales
13310: 
13311: We’ll achieve nothing by that game,
13312: Meet Proteus: he’ll vanish, just the same:   8155
13313: And if he stays, he’ll only tell you,
13314: What will amaze you, and confuse you.
13315: But you’ve need of such advice,
13316: Well, make tracks, then, and we’ll try!
13317: 
13318: (They depart.)
13319: 
13320: The Sirens (On the rocks above.)
13321: 
13322: What is it we see whitening                  8160
13323: The realms of ocean, brightening?
13324: As when the wind prevails,
13325: And shows the snowy sails,
13326: So the Ocean’s daughters,
13327: Transfigured, light the waters.              8165
13328: Let us clamber shore-wards,
13329: So we can hear their voices.
13330: 
13331: The Nereids and Tritons
13332: 
13333: What in our hands we treasure,
13334: Will give you all great pleasure.
13335: Chelone’s turtle shield                      8170
13336: The shining form we wield:
13337: On it gods we’re bringing:
13338: Your noblest songs, be singing.
13339: 
13340: The Sirens
13341: 
13342: Little in form,
13343: Great in the storm,                          8175
13344: Saving the shipwrecked,
13345: Gods always respected.
13346: 
13347: The Nereid and Tritons
13348: 
13349: We bring the peaceful Cabiri
13350: To lead in your festivity,
13351: Since in their holy presence,        8180
13352: Neptune’s always pleasant.
13353: 
13354: The Sirens
13355: 
13356: We’re attendant on you:
13357: When a ship broke in two,
13358: Their sovereign power too,
13359: Protected the crew.                  8185
13360: 
13361: The Nereids and Tritons
13362: 
13363: We’ve brought three of them along,
13364: The fourth said he wouldn’t come:
13365: He said he was the real one,
13366: The only thinker of the squadron.
13367: 
13368: The Sirens
13369: 
13370: One god will always mock             8190
13371: At some other god.
13372: Honour all their courtesy,
13373: Be fearful of their injury.
13374: 
13375: The Nereids and Tritons
13376: 
13377: Actually, there are seven.
13378: 
13379: The Sirens
13380: 
13381: Where are the other three, then?     8195
13382: 
13383: The Nereids and Tritons
13384: We really can’t tell you that,
13385: On Olympus one might ask:
13386: There the eighth pines away,
13387: No one thinks of him today!
13388: Granted us in mercy,                   8200
13389: But not yet completely.
13390: These, the incomparable,
13391: Ever wider yearning,
13392: Hungering, are longing
13393: For the unattainable.                  8205
13394: 
13395: The Sirens
13396: 
13397: We’re ones who know
13398: Where it’s enthroned,
13399: To moon and to sun,
13400: We pray: and it’s done.
13401: 
13402: The Nereids and Tritons
13403: 
13404: See how our great glory grows,         8210
13405: We lead them to the feast!
13406: 
13407: The Sirens
13408: 
13409: The heroes of ancient story,
13410: Are deficient now in glory,
13411: Whatever we might be told:
13412: Though they won the fleece of gold,    8215
13413: You’re the Cabiri.
13414: 
13415: (Repeated as a full chorus.)
13416: 
13417: ‘Though they won the fleece of gold,
13418: We’re the Cabiri’.
13419: 
13420: (The Nereids and Tritons move past.)
13421: 
13422: Homunculus
13423: I see these unformed ones,
13424: Like pots of shoddy clay,                                       8220
13425: Against them wise men run,
13426: And break their heads today.
13427: 
13428: Thales
13429: 
13430: That’s what men ask of the dust:
13431: The coin gains value from its rust.
13432: 
13433: Proteus (Unnoticed.)
13434: 
13435: It pleases me, an old connoisseur of fable!                     8225
13436: The odder it is, the more respectable.
13437: 
13438: Thales
13439: 
13440: Where are you, Proteus?
13441: 
13442: Proteus (Like a ventriloquist, apparently far, and close to.)
13443: 
13444:                    Here! Here, too!
13445: 
13446: Thales
13447: 
13448: An old joke, which I’ll forgive you:
13449: No idle words for a friend, please!
13450: I know you’re trying to deceive.                                8230
13451: 
13452: Proteus (As if from the distance.)
13453: 
13454: Farewell!
13455: 
13456: Thales (Quietly to Homunculus.)
13457: 
13458:       He’s quite near. So, light, afresh!
13459: He’s just as curious as any fish:
13460: And whatever form he hides in,
13461: A flame will easily entice him.
13462: Homunculus
13463: 
13464: I’ll pour out a whole flood of light,                8235
13465: But soft, so the glass is still all right.
13466: 
13467: Proteus (In the form of a giant turtle.)
13468: 
13469: What shines with such grace and beauty?
13470: 
13471: Thales (Covering up Homunculus.)
13472: 
13473: Good! If you wish, come close to see.
13474: It’s worth a little trouble, if you can:
13475: Show yourself two-footed like a man.                 8240
13476: At our discretion, and by our favour.
13477: We’ll show you what we’re hiding here.
13478: 
13479: Proteus (In a noble form.)
13480: 
13481: You still know all the worldly tricks.
13482: 
13483: Thales
13484: 
13485: Changing shape is what you still like best.
13486: 
13487: (He reveals Homunculus.)
13488: 
13489: Proteus (Astonished.)
13490: 
13491: A shining dwarf! That, I’ve never seen!       8245
13492: 
13493: Thales
13494: 
13495: He seeks advice, and would gladly ‘be’.
13496: He is, as I’ve heard him say before,
13497: Quite miraculously, only half born.
13498: He’s not lacking in mental qualities,
13499: But short of physical capabilities:                  8250
13500: Only the glass has given him weight at all,
13501: He’d gladly be embodied, first of all.
13502: Proteus
13503: 
13504: You are a true virgin’s son,
13505: Before you should be, you’re already one!
13506: 
13507: Thales (Whispering.)
13508: 
13509: From another point of view, it’s critical:   8255
13510: I think it makes him hermaphroditical.
13511: 
13512: Proteus
13513: 
13514: All the easier to achieve success:
13515: Whatever he gets will suit him best.
13516: No need to think about it here:
13517: In the ocean deep you must appear!           8260
13518: There, first, in miniature, one snatches,
13519: Enjoying the smallest things to swallow,
13520: Bigger and bigger, with what one catches,
13521: Forming the higher being to follow.
13522: 
13523: Homunculus
13524: 
13525: Here quite gentle breezes blow,              8265
13526: It’s open: the fragrance delights me so!
13527: 
13528: Proteus
13529: 
13530: I think so too, loveliest of youths!
13531: And, further on, it’s more enjoyable:
13532: On that shoreline’s slender tooth,
13533: The watery halo’s indescribable.             8270
13534: There we’ll see the crowds near to,
13535: Drifting smoothly, to our view,
13536: Come with me!
13537: Thales
13538: 
13539:    I’ll keep you company.
13540: 
13541: Homunculus
13542: 
13543: A triply odd spirit-journey!
13544: Part II Act II Scene VI: The Telchines of Rhodes
13545: 
13546: (The Telchines, on sea-horses and dragons, wielding Neptune’s trident.)
13547: 
13548: Chorus of Telchines (The nine dog-headed Children of the Sea)
13549: 
13550: Oh, we are the ones who once forged Neptune’s trident,               8275
13551: With which he controls the tumultuous torrent.
13552: When the thunder erupts from the heavens, and rumbles,
13553: Neptune will reply to those terrible grumbles:
13554: And however the lightning zig-zags above us,
13555: Breaker upon breaker beneath will splash upwards:                    8280
13556: And whatever struggles between them in terror,
13557: Long hurled all about, the deep seas will devour:
13558: And that’s why he’s loaned us his sceptre today –
13559: Now we float, calm and light, in our festive display.
13560: 
13561: The Sirens
13562: 
13563: You, to Helios consecrated,                                          8285
13564: You, with bright day’s blessing freighted,
13565: Greetings to this hour when
13566: Luna’s high worship rules again!
13567: 
13568: The Telchines
13569: 
13570: Loveliest goddess of all in your sphere above!
13571: To hear your brother praised, is something you love.                 8290
13572: To blessed Rhodes lend an ear, now, from the sky,
13573: Where an endless Paean, to him, rises on high.
13574: He begins the day’s course: he ends it again,
13575: He eyes us all with his radiant fiery eye, then.
13576: The mountains, the city, the sea and the strand,                     8295
13577: Please the great god, lovely and bright is the land.
13578: No mist drifts above us, and if one appears,
13579: A ray, and a breeze: and the island shows clear!
13580: There the high god’s in hundreds of statues displayed,
13581: As a youth, and a giant, the mild and the grave.                     8300
13582: We were the first to carve forms: we began
13583: The depiction of gods in the image of Man.
13584: Proteus
13585: 
13586: Let them sing on then, and let them boast!
13587: To the sun’s sacred rays, a living host,
13588: All their works are an empty jest.           8305
13589: They melt and shape untiringly:
13590: And once, in bronze, it’s plain to see,
13591: They think they’ve caught the very best.
13592: What happens at last to these proud ones?
13593: The god’s statues standing high –            8310
13594: An earthquake tosses to the sky:
13595: Long since, they’re all melted down.
13596: Earth’s toil, whatever else it may be,
13597: Is nothing still, but drudgery:
13598: The waves grant a life that’s better:        8315
13599: I’ll bear you to eternal waters,
13600: As Proteus-Dolphin.
13601: 
13602: (Transforming himself.)
13603: 
13604:                That’s soon done!
13605: Now you’ll find your fairest luck:
13606: I’m carrying you across my back,
13607: To wed you with the ocean.                   8320
13608: 
13609: Thales
13610: 
13611: Yield to your praiseworthy wish,
13612: Start at the beginning, with the fish!
13613: Be ready for the swiftest working!
13614: Be ruled by the eternal norms,
13615: Move through a thousand, thousand forms,     8325
13616: And you’ll ascend in time to Man.
13617: 
13618: Proteus
13619: 
13620: With spirit, join the watery plan,
13621: Equal in size, where all began,
13622: And move here as you wish to do:
13623: Don’t wrestle with the higher orders:             8330
13624: Once man, inside mankind’s borders,
13625: Then all will be over with you.
13626: 
13627: Thales
13628: 
13629: That’s as may be: it’s still fine,
13630: To be a real man, in your own time.
13631: 
13632: Proteus (To Thales.)
13633: 
13634: As long as it’s someone of your kind!             8335
13635: You don’t just live for some brief time:
13636: With your pale and ghostly peers,
13637: I’ve watched you already for hundreds of years.
13638: 
13639: The Sirens (On the rocky cliffs.)
13640: 
13641: What’s that ring of little clouds, set
13642: In a circle round the moon?                       8340
13643: They are doves, by love ignited,
13644: Winged, white as winter noon.
13645: All her ardent flocks of birds:
13646: Paphos, now, has sent to us,
13647: So our festival’s completed,                      8345
13648: Sweet and clear our happy bliss!
13649: 
13650: Nereus (Approaching Thales.)
13651: 
13652: Though some nocturnal wanderer
13653: Might call it only airy moonshine:
13654: We spirits think it something other,
13655: It’s one true meaning we can find:                8350
13656: They are doves that accompany
13657: My daughter in her moving shell.
13658: Wondrous flights of artistry,
13659: Learnt in ancient times, as well.
13660: Thales
13661: 
13662: I too think that thing is best,                                      8355
13663: That can please the real man,
13664: And in warm and silent nest,
13665: Keep living Sacredness to hand.
13666: 
13667: Psylli and Marsi (Peoples of Italy and North Africa. On sea-bulls, sea-
13668: heifers and sea-rams.)
13669: 
13670: In the hollow caves of Cyprus
13671: Not yet rocked, by the sea-god,                                       8360
13672: Not yet shaken, by old Seismos,
13673: Breathed on, by eternal breezes,
13674: And, as in the ancient days,
13675: Delighting in peaceful ways,
13676: With us Venus’ chariot stays,                                         8365
13677: And through nocturnal murmurs,
13678: Through the sweet entwining waters,
13679: We lead the loveliest of daughters,
13680: Unseen by newer generation.
13681: Travelling on our gentle journey                                      8370
13682: No winged lion, or eagle fear we,
13683: Neither cross nor crescent,
13684: Though it’s throned in heaven,
13685: Though it moves and sways,
13686: Though it drives and slays,                                          8375
13687: Crops, towns, in ruin lays.
13688: We, swiftly bring on
13689: The loveliest of women.
13690: 
13691: The Sirens
13692: 
13693: Lightly now, and gently go,
13694: Round the chariot, ring on ring,                                      8380
13695: Often weaving, row by row,
13696: All in order, round it, snaking,
13697: Approach you active Nereids
13698: Sturdy women, sweetly wild,
13699: Tender Dorides bring, amidst,                                         8385
13700: Galatea, Mother’s child:
13701: Most, so goddess-like her calm,
13702: Worthy of immortality,
13703: Yet enticing, with her charm,
13704: As human femininity.                                            8390
13705: 
13706: The Dorides (In Chorus, mounted on dolphins, passing Nereus.)
13707: 
13708: Lend us, Luna, light and shadow,
13709: Clarity for flowering youth!
13710: Charming husbands here we show:
13711: Plead for them with our father, too.
13712: 
13713: (To Nereus.)
13714: 
13715: They are boys, whom we rescued                                  8395
13716: From the breaker’s teeth, and then,
13717: In the reeds and mosses bedded,
13718: Warmed them back to life again,
13719: Now with glowing kisses they
13720: Must thank us truly here today:                                 8400
13721: Look with favour now on them!
13722: 
13723: Nereus
13724: 
13725: Here there’s a dual prize, I find, to treasure:
13726: You show compassion, and it brings you pleasure.
13727: 
13728: The Dorides
13729: 
13730: Father, praise our mission, all,
13731: And sanction our fond request,                                  8405
13732: Let us hold them fast, immortal,
13733: On each young eternal breast.
13734: 
13735: Nereus
13736: 
13737: Be happy with your handsome catch,
13738: Accept the youngsters here, as men:
13739: I can’t myself grant what you ask,                              8410
13740: Since Zeus alone can make it happen.
13741: The waves that heave and rock you
13742: Leave no place for love to stand,
13743: So when this inclination leaves you,
13744: Send them quietly back to land.                   8415
13745: 
13746: The Dorides
13747: 
13748: Sweet boys, you are so dear to us,
13749: But sadly we must separate:
13750: We asked eternal faithfulness,
13751: But the gods forbid that fate.
13752: 
13753: The Young Men
13754: 
13755: We’re the valiant sailor lads,                    8420
13756: If you’d refresh us further,
13757: We’ve never had it quite so good
13758: And we’ll never have it better.
13759: 
13760: (Galatea approaches on her shell-chariot.)
13761: 
13762: Nereus
13763: 
13764: It’s you, my darling!
13765: 
13766: Galatea
13767: 
13768:                             O father! Delight!
13769: Linger, you dolphins, I’m gripped by the sight.   8425
13770: 
13771: Nereus
13772: 
13773: Past already, they’re moving past,
13774: Wheeling in circular motion:
13775: What care they for the heart’s deep emotion!
13776: Ah, if they’d just take me with them, at last!
13777: And yet, a single glance gives here,              8430
13778: Something that will last all year.
13779: Thales
13780: 
13781: Hail! Hail! Anew!
13782: How happy I feel, too,
13783: Pierced by the Beautiful and True….
13784: All things came from the watery view!               8435
13785: All things are sustained by water!
13786: Ocean, grant us your realm forever.
13787: If you didn’t produce the clouds,
13788: No flowing streams would be allowed,
13789: The rivers wouldn’t roar and shout,                 8440
13790: The streams would never bubble out,
13791: Where would hill, plain, and world be then?
13792: The freshness of life’s what you maintain.
13793: 
13794: An Echo (A chorus from the collective circles.)
13795: 
13796: The freshness of life flows back from you, again.
13797: 
13798: Nereus
13799: 
13800: Floating, turning, they change place,               8445
13801: Far off, no longer face to face:
13802: In extended linking circles,
13803: Appropriate to the festival,
13804: The countless company’s weaving.
13805: But Galatea’s throne of shell,                      8450
13806: I see it clearly: see it still.
13807: It gleams like a star,
13808: Through the throng,
13809: A crowd, the Beloved shines among!
13810: Though just as far,                                 8455
13811: It shimmers bright and clear,
13812: Always true, and near.
13813: 
13814: Homunculus
13815: 
13816: In this delightful ocean
13817: Whatever I may shine on,
13818: Is all sweet and fair.                              8460
13819: Proteus
13820: 
13821: In this living ocean,
13822: You light’s shining motion,
13823: First rings in splendour there.
13824: 
13825: Nereus
13826: 
13827: At the heart of the throng, what mystery
13828: Offers itself for our eyes to see?                   8465
13829: What shines round the shell, at Galatea’s feet?
13830: Now waxing powerful, now gentle and sweet,
13831: As if it were fed by the pulses of Love.
13832: 
13833: Thales
13834: 
13835: Homunculus, drawn there by Proteus….
13836: Those are the symptoms of imperious yearning,        8470
13837: I’d expect now the sound of an anguished ringing:
13838: He’ll shatter himself on the glittering throne:
13839: He glitters, he flashes, already, it’s done.
13840: 
13841: The Sirens
13842: 
13843: What fiery wonder transfigures the waves, there,
13844: As one on another sparkles and breaks, there?        8475
13845: It flashes and flickers and brightens towards us:
13846: The nocturnal tracks of the bodies shine round us,
13847: And everything near is surrounded with flame:
13848: So let Eros rule, now: who started the game!
13849: Hail to the sea! Hail to the waves!                  8480
13850: Circled, now, by the sacred blaze!
13851: Hail to water! Hail to fire!
13852: Hail to the rarest sweet desire!
13853: 
13854: All In Chorus
13855: 
13856: Hail, the gently flowing breeze!
13857: Hail, hidden caverns of the seas!                    8485
13858: Be honoured now, for evermore,
13859: You, the Elemental four!
13860: Part II Act III Scene I: Before the Palace of Menelaus in Sparta
13861: 
13862: (Helen enters with the Chorus of Captive Trojan Women. Panthalis is leader
13863: of the Chorus.)
13864: 
13865: Helen
13866: 
13867: I, Helen the much admired yet much reviled,
13868: Come from the shore, where recently we landed,
13869: Still drunk with the violent rocking of those waves                 8490
13870: That from Phrygian heights on high-arched backs,
13871: By Poseidon’s favour, and the East Wind’s power,
13872: Carried us here to the coast of my native land.
13873: There, below us, beside his bravest soldiers
13874: King Menelaus, now, celebrates his return.                          8495
13875: But you, bid me welcome, you, the lofty house
13876: Tyndareus my father built when he returned,
13877: Close by the slope of Pallas Athene’s hill:
13878: Here, where with Clytemnestra, in sisterhood, I
13879: And Castor and Pollux, grew and happily played:                     8500
13880: You, more nobly adorned than all Sparta’s houses.
13881: Be greeted by me, you honoured double doors!
13882: Once, Menelaus the shining bridegroom came
13883: To me, through your friendly inviting portals,
13884: I, the one singled out from among so many.                          8505
13885: Open to me once more, so that I might fulfil,
13886: The King’s command, truly, as a wife should.
13887: Let me pass! And let everything be left behind,
13888: That raged round me, till now, so full of doom.
13889: For since, light in heart, I left this place behind,                8510
13890: Seeking out Venus’ temple, in sacred duty,
13891: Where instead a Trojan robber abducted me,
13892: Many things have happened, men, far and wide,
13893: Gladly tell of, though she’s not so glad to hear them,
13894: Round whom the story grew, and myth was spun.                       8515
13895: 
13896: Chorus
13897: 
13898: O marvellous woman, don’t disdain
13899: Inheritance of the noblest estate!
13900: For the highest fate’s granted to you alone,
13901: The glory of beauty that towers above all.
13902: The Hero’s name sounds his advance,                   8520
13903: And proudly he strides:
13904: But he bows down, most stubborn of men,
13905: Before conquering Beauty, in mind and sense.
13906: 
13907: Helen
13908: 
13909: Enough of that! I’m brought here by my husband,
13910: I’ve been sent ahead by him, now, to his city:        8525
13911: But what the meaning of it is I can hardly guess.
13912: Do I come as his wife? Do I come as the Queen?
13913: Or a sacrifice, for a Prince’s bitter pain,
13914: And the ill fortune long endured by the Greeks?
13915: I’m conquered: but am I a prisoner? I can’t tell!     8530
13916: True, the Immortals appointed Fame, and Fate,
13917: As the two ambiguous, doubtful companions
13918: Of Beauty, to stand here at this threshold with me,
13919: The gloomy, threatening presences by my side.
13920: Even in the hollow ship my husband seldom             8535
13921: Gazed at me, or spoke an encouraging word.
13922: He sat in front of me, as if in evil thought.
13923: But scarcely had the foremost ship’s prow greeted
13924: Land, in that deep bay Eurotas’ mouth has made,
13925: Than he spoke to us, as the gods had urged him:       8540
13926: ‘Here my soldiers will disembark in ordered ranks,
13927: I’ll muster them, ranged along the ocean’s-shore:
13928: But you’ll go on, ever on along the banks
13929: Of sacred Eurotas, shining with bright orchards,
13930: Guide the horses through gleaming water meadows,      8545
13931: Till of your lovely journey you make an end,
13932: Where Lacedemon, once a rich spreading field,
13933: Surrounded by austere mountains, was created.
13934: Walk through the high-towered house of princes,
13935: And summon the capable old Stewardess                 8550
13936: Along with the maidservants I left behind,
13937: Let her display the store of rich treasure to you,
13938: That which your father left, and that I myself
13939: Have added to, amassing it in war and peace.
13940: You’ll find it all still in the most perfect order:    8555
13941: It is a prince’s privilege that he should find
13942: That all is loyalty, on returning to his house,
13943: All that he’s left behind still in its proper place.
13944: Since no slave has the power to effect a change.’
13945: 
13946: Chorus
13947: 
13948: Let this treasure, so steadily massed,                 8560
13949: Bring you delight, now, in eye and breast!
13950: For the necklace bright, and the crown of gold,
13951: Were resting, and darkening, in proud repose:
13952: But enter now, and claim them all,
13953: They’ll quickly respond.                               8565
13954: I love to see Beauty itself compete
13955: Against gold and pearls and glittering gems.
13956: 
13957: Helen
13958: 
13959: So again there came my lord’s imperious speech:
13960: ‘When you’ve examined all of it in due order,
13961: Take as many tripods as you think you’ll need,         8570
13962: And as many vessels as sacrifice requires,
13963: To fulfil the customs of the sacred rites.
13964: Take cauldrons, and basins, and circular bowls:
13965: The purest of water from the holy fountains,
13966: In deep urns: take care that you’ve dry wood too,      8575
13967: Such as will quickly catch fire, and hold all ready:
13968: And finally don’t forget a well-honed knife:
13969: Everything else I’ll leave for your decision.’
13970: So he spoke, at the same time urging my going:
13971: But he who commanded marked out nothing living         8580
13972: To be slain: to honour the Olympian gods.
13973: Essential, but I’ll think no more about it,
13974: And leave all things in the hands of the gods:
13975: They fulfil whatever is in their mind to do,
13976: Whether or not we think it good or evil:               8585
13977: In either case we mortals must endure it.
13978: Often the priest’s heavy axe has been lifted,
13979: From the bowed neck of the sacrificial victim,
13980: So he could not slaughter it, being hindered,
13981: By enemies near, or the gods’ intervention.        8590
13982: 
13983: Chorus
13984: 
13985: What might happen, think not of that:
13986: Queen, go on, now, step inside,
13987: And be brave!
13988: Good and evil come
13989: Unannounced, to Mankind:                           8595
13990: Though it’s proclaimed, we’ll not believe.
13991: Troy still burned: did we not see
13992: Death in our faces, shameful death:
13993: And are we not here,
13994: Your friends, happily serving,                     8600
13995: Seeing the blinding sun in the sky
13996: Seeing the Loveliest on Earth,
13997: You, the kind: we the joyous?
13998: 
13999: Helen
14000: 
14001: Let it be, as it will! Whatever awaits me,
14002: I must go, swiftly, up to that royal house,        8605
14003: Long forsaken, often longed for, almost lost,
14004: That’s before my eyes once more: I know not how.
14005: My feet don’t carry me onwards so bravely, now,
14006: Up those high steps, I skipped over as a child.
14007: 
14008: Chorus
14009: 
14010: Sorrowful prisoners,                               8610
14011: Oh, cast away, Sisters,
14012: All your pain, to the winds:
14013: Share in your mistress’ joy
14014: Share now in Helen’s joy,
14015: Who returns, truly late indeed,
14016: To her father’s hearth and home,                   8615
14017: But with all the more firm a step,
14018: Delightedly approaching.
14019: Praise the sacred gods,
14020: Creating happiness,                                     8620
14021: Bringing the wanderer home!
14022: See the freed prisoner
14023: Soar on uplifted wings,
14024: Over harshness, while, all in vain,
14025: The captives, so full of longing,                       8625
14026: Pine away, arms still outstretched,
14027: To the walls of their prison.
14028: 
14029: But a god snatched her up, then,
14030: The far-exiled:
14031: And from Ilium’s fall,                                  8630
14032: Carried her back once more, home
14033: To the old, to the newly adorned, her
14034: Father’s house,
14035: From unspeakable
14036: Rapture and torment,                                    8635
14037: Now, reborn, to remember
14038: The days of her childhood.
14039: 
14040: Panthalis (As leader of the Chorus.)
14041: 
14042: Now leave behind the joyful path of your singing,
14043: And turn your eyes towards the open doorway!
14044: Sisters, what do I see! Surely the Queen returns        8640
14045: Waking towards us, again, with anxious steps?
14046: What is it, great Queen? What can you have met with,
14047: Within the halls of your house, instead of greetings,
14048: To cause you such trembling? You can hide nothing,
14049: Since I see your reluctance written on your brow,       8645
14050: And amazement competes there with noble anger.
14051: 
14052: Helen (Who has left the doors open, in her turmoil.)
14053: 
14054: A daughter of Zeus is stirred by no common fear,
14055: No lightly passing hand of Terror can touch her:
14056: Only the Horror that the womb of ancient Night,
14057: Raised from chaos, and shaped in its many forms,        8650
14058: In glowing clouds that shoot, upwards and outwards,
14059: From the peak’s fiery throat, to shake the hero’s breast.
14060: So here today the Stygian gods have marked
14061: The entrance to my house with terror: and gladly
14062: I’d take myself far away, like a guest let go,                8655
14063: Far from this often trodden, long yearned for threshold.
14064: But no! I’ve retreated here now, into the light,
14065: And you Powers will drive me no further, whoever
14066: You are. Rather, I’ll think of some consecration,
14067: So the hearth-fire, cleansed, greets the wife, as the lord.   8660
14068: 
14069: The Leader of the Chorus
14070: 
14071: Noble lady, reveal to your maidservants here,
14072: Who help you reverently, what has happened.
14073: 
14074: Helen
14075: 
14076: You’ll see what I saw yourselves, with your own eyes,
14077: If ancient Night has not, straight away, swallowed it,
14078: That shape of hers: withdrawn it to her heart’s depths.       8665
14079: But I’ll picture it to you in words, so you’ll know:
14080: As, with those recent orders in mind, I trod,
14081: Gravely, through the palace’s innermost room,
14082: Awed by the silence of the gloomy corridors,
14083: No sound of busy labour greeting my ears,                     8670
14084: No sound of prompt, diligent effort meeting my eye,
14085: No Stewardess appeared, and no maidservants,
14086: No courtesy such as usually greets the stranger.
14087: But as I approached closer to the hearth stone
14088: Beside the glowing ashes that remained, I saw                 8675
14089: A veiled woman, vast shape, seated on the floor,
14090: Not like one who’s asleep, but one deep in thought.
14091: I summoned her to work, with words of command,
14092: Thinking she was the Stewardess whom my husband,
14093: Had placed there perhaps, with foresight, when he left.       8680
14094: But she still sat there, crouched and immoveable:
14095: At last, stirred by my threats, she raised her arm,
14096: As if she gestured me away from hearth and hall.
14097: I turned aside from her, angrily, and sped,
14098: To the steps where the Thalamos is adorned                    8685
14099: On high, and close beside it the treasure house:
14100: Suddenly that strange shape sprang up from the floor,
14101: Barring my way, imperiously, showing herself,
14102: Tall and haggard, with hollow, blood-coloured gaze:
14103: A shape so weird that mind and eye were troubled.             8690
14104: But I talk to the wind: for words weary themselves
14105: Trying to conjure forms, vainly, like some creator.
14106: See for yourselves! She even dares the daylight!
14107: Here am I mistress, till the King, my lord, shall come.
14108: Phoebus, beauty’s friend, drives the horrid spawn of Night    8695
14109: To caverns underground, or he binds them fast.
14110: 
14111: (Phorkyas appears on the threshold, between the doorposts.)
14112: 
14113: Chorus
14114: 
14115: Much have I learned, although the locks
14116: Curl youthfully still across my temples!
14117: Many the terrible things I’ve seen,
14118: The soldiers’ misery, Ilium’s night,                          8700
14119: When it fell.
14120: 
14121: Through the clouded, and dust-filled turmoil,
14122: The press of warriors, I heard the gods
14123: Calling terribly, heard the ringing
14124: Iron voice of Discord through the field,                      8705
14125: City-wards.
14126: 
14127: Ah! They still stood there, Ilium’s
14128: Walls, but the glow of the flames
14129: Soon ran from neighbour to neighbour,
14130: Ever spreading, hither and thither,                           8710
14131: With the breath of their storm,
14132: Over the darkening city.
14133: Fleeing, through smoke and heat, I saw
14134: Amid the tongues of soaring fire,
14135: The fearful angry presence of gods,          8715
14136: Marvellous, those striding figures,
14137: Like giants, they were, through the gloom,
14138: The fire-illumined vapour.
14139: 
14140: Did I see that Confusion,
14141: Or did the fear-consumed Spirit              8720
14142: Create it? Never will I be able,
14143: To say, but I’m truly certain
14144: Of this, that here I see, Her,
14145: Monstrous shape to my eyes:
14146: My hand could even touch Her,                8725
14147: If terror did not restrain me,
14148: Saving me from danger.
14149: 
14150: Which of the daughters
14151: Of Phorkyas are you?
14152: Since I liken you                            8730
14153: To that family.
14154: 
14155: Are you perhaps one of the Graeae,
14156: A single eye and a single tooth,
14157: Owned alternately between you,
14158: One born of greyness?                        8735
14159: 
14160: Monster, do you dare
14161: Here, next to Beauty,
14162: Show yourself to Phoebus,
14163: And his knowing gaze?
14164: 
14165: Then step out before him regardless:         8740
14166: Since he’ll not look at what’s ugly,
14167: Just as his holy eye,
14168: Has never seen shadow.
14169: Yet we mortals are compelled, ah,
14170: By unfortunate gloomy fate,                                8745
14171: To the unspeakably painful sight
14172: She, reprehensible, ever ill fated,
14173: Provokes in the lover of Beauty.
14174: 
14175: Yet hear me then, if you boldly
14176: Encounter us: hear the curse,                              8750
14177: Hear the threat of every abuse,
14178: From the condemnatory mouth of the fortunate,
14179: Whom the gods themselves have created.
14180: 
14181: Phorkyas (The transformed Mephistopheles.)
14182: 
14183: The saying is old, with meaning noble and true,
14184: That Beauty and Shame, together, hand in hand,             8755
14185: Never pursue the same path, over green Earth.
14186: Such ancient, deep-rooted hatred lives in both,
14187: That whenever they meet, by chance, on the way,
14188: The one will always turn her back on her rival.
14189: Then quickly and fiercely each goes on, again,             8760
14190: Shame downcast, but Beauty mocking in spirit,
14191: Till in the end Orcus’ dark void shall take her,
14192: If age hasn’t, long before then, tamed her pride.
14193: So now I find you, impudent, come from abroad,
14194: With overflowing arrogance, like the cranes,               8765
14195: Their noisily croaking ranks, high overhead,
14196: Their long cloud, sending its creaking tones, down here,
14197: Tempting the quiet traveller to look upwards:
14198: Yet they pursue their way, while he follows his:
14199: And that’s the way it will be with us as well.             8770
14200: What then are you, wild Maenads or Bacchantes,
14201: That dare to rage round the great royal palace?
14202: Who are you, then, who howl at this high house’s
14203: Stewardess, like a pack of bitches, at the moon?
14204: Do you think it’s hidden from me what race you are?        8775
14205: You brood, begotten in battle, raised on slaughter,
14206: Lusting for men, the seducers and the seduced,
14207: Draining the soldiers’ and the citizens’ powers!
14208: To see your crowd’s like watching a vast swarm
14209: Of locusts settle here, darkening the fields.           8780
14210: You the wasters of others labour! Nibbling,
14211: Destroying, the ripening crops of prosperity!
14212: Defeated, bartered, sold in the market, you!
14213: 
14214: Helen
14215: 
14216: Who abuses the servants before the mistress,
14217: Presumptuously usurping a wife’s true rights?           8785
14218: Only to her is it given to praise whatever’s
14219: Praiseworthy: and to punish what is at fault.
14220: I’m well content, as well, with all the services
14221: They provided to me, when Ilium’s great might,
14222: Stood beleaguered, and fell in ruins: none the less     8790
14223: Just as we’ve endured the wretched wandering
14224: Journey, where often one thinks only of oneself,
14225: So here I expect it now from a happier crew:
14226: A lord asks how slaves serve, not what they are.
14227: So be silent, then, and no longer jeer at them.         8795
14228: If you’ve guarded the king’s house well until now,
14229: In place of the mistress, such is to your credit:
14230: But now that she comes herself, you should draw back,
14231: Lest you find punishment instead of fair reward.
14232: 
14233: Phorkyas
14234: 
14235: Disciplining servants is a prerogative                  8800
14236: That the noble wife of a king, loved by the gods,
14237: Has duly earned by years of wise discretion.
14238: Since you, acknowledged, take up your former place
14239: Once more, as Queen, and mistress of the house,
14240: Resume the slackened reins again, and rule here,        8805
14241: Hold the treasure in your keeping, and us with it.
14242: But first of all defend me, who am the elder,
14243: Against this crowd, who if they are compared
14244: To your swanlike beauty, are only cackling geese.
14245: The Leader of the Chorus
14246: 
14247: How ugly ugliness looks, next to beauty.                            8810
14248: 
14249: Phorkyas
14250: 
14251: How stupid the lack of reason, next to sense.
14252: 
14253: (From here on the Chorus answer in turn, stepping forward one by one.)
14254: 
14255: First Member of the Chorus
14256: 
14257: Tell us of Father Erebus: tell us of Mother Night.
14258: 
14259: Phorkyas
14260: 
14261: Speak about Scylla, sweet sister of your race.
14262: 
14263: Second Member of the Chorus
14264: 
14265: There are plenty of monsters in your family tree.
14266: 
14267: Phorkyas
14268: 
14269: Go down to Orcus, look for your tribe down there!                   8815
14270: 
14271: Third Member of the Chorus
14272: 
14273: Those who are down there are far too young for you.
14274: 
14275: Phorkyas
14276: 
14277: Try your arts of seduction on old Tiresias.
14278: 
14279: Fourth Member of the Chorus
14280: 
14281: Orion’s nurse was your great great-grandchild.
14282: Phorkyas
14283: 
14284: I suspect that the Harpies raised you all, on filth.
14285: 
14286: Fifth Member of the Chorus
14287: 
14288: What do you feed your perfect leanness on?                8820
14289: 
14290: Phorkyas
14291: 
14292: Not on the blood that you all lust so much for.
14293: 
14294: Sixth Member of the Chorus
14295: 
14296: You hunger for corpses, you, foul corpse yourself!
14297: 
14298: Phorkyas
14299: 
14300: Vampire’s teeth gleam there, in your shameless muzzle.
14301: 
14302: The Leader of the Chorus
14303: 
14304: It would shut yours tight, if I called out who you are.
14305: 
14306: Phorkyas
14307: 
14308: Well say your own name first: that’ll solve the riddle.          8825
14309: 
14310: Helen
14311: 
14312: I intervene, not in anger but in sorrow,
14313: To forbid this alternating discord!
14314: A ruler meets with nothing that’s more harmful
14315: Than private disputes of his quarrelling servants.
14316: Then his firm orders are no longer answered                      8830
14317: With swiftly answering and harmonious action,
14318: Instead, wilful commotion roars around him:
14319: Self-composure lost, he abuses them in vain.
14320: Not only that. Unacceptably, in anger,
14321: You’ve summoned the wretched shapes of dreadful forms,           8835
14322: They surround me, so I feel I’m being whirled
14323: To Orcus, from these familiar paternal fields.
14324: Am I remembering? Did delusion grip me?
14325: Was I all of that? Am I, now? And shall be still,
14326: Symbol of dream and fear, to those who waste cities?   8840
14327: The maidservants shudder, but you, the eldest,
14328: Stand there calmly: speak words of reason to me!
14329: 
14330: Phorkyas
14331: 
14332: The favour of the gods seems only a dream
14333: To one who recalls the troubles of long ages.
14334: But you, blessed, beyond all aim and measure,          8845
14335: Quickly inflamed to every sort of daring risk,
14336: Only found fires of love, in the realm of life,
14337: Theseus, driven by lust, abducted you, a child,
14338: He strong as Hercules: a man nobly formed.
14339: 
14340: Helen
14341: 
14342: He carried me off, a slender ten-year old fawn,        8850
14343: And caged me in Aphidnus’ tower in Attica.
14344: 
14345: Phorkyas
14346: 
14347: But soon freed, by the hands of Castor and Pollux,
14348: A crowd of suitors, the heroes, swarmed round you.
14349: 
14350: Helen
14351: 
14352: Yet, I freely confess, above all, Patroclus
14353: The image of Achilles, had my secret favour,           8855
14354: 
14355: Phorkyas
14356: 
14357: But your father’s will bound you to Menelaus,
14358: The brave sea rover, the defender of his house.
14359: Helen
14360: 
14361: He gave him his daughter, and command of the state.
14362: Hermione came from our married existence.
14363: 
14364: Phorkyas
14365: 
14366: But while he disputed his right to far off Crete,     8860
14367: To you, the lonely, came all too handsome a guest.
14368: 
14369: Helen
14370: 
14371: Why do you recall that semi-widowhood,
14372: And all the terrible ruin it caused around me?
14373: 
14374: Phorkyas
14375: 
14376: To me, a free-born Cretan, his same journey
14377: Brought captivity and years of slavery.               8865
14378: 
14379: Helen
14380: 
14381: He ordered you here at once, as Stewardess,
14382: Entrusting the fortress and his treasure to you.
14383: 
14384: Phorkyas
14385: 
14386: Which you abandoned, for Ilium’s high city,
14387: And the inexhaustible delights of love.
14388: 
14389: Helen
14390: 
14391: Not delights, be sure! All too bitter a sorrow        8870
14392: Was poured endlessly over my head and breast.
14393: 
14394: Phorkyas
14395: 
14396: Yet they say that you appeared in dual form,
14397: Seen in Troy and, at the same time, in Egypt.
14398: Helen
14399: 
14400: Don’t confuse my clouded, wandering mind completely.
14401: To this moment, I don’t know which of them I am.       8875
14402: 
14403: Phorkyas
14404: 
14405: Then they say: Achilles became your companion,
14406: Came, burning, from the empty realm of shadows!
14407: He’d loved you before, opposing fate’s command.
14408: 
14409: Helen
14410: 
14411: As phantom, I bound myself to a phantom.
14412: It was a dream, as the tales themselves tell.          8880
14413: I fade, now, become a phantom to myself.
14414: 
14415: (She sinks into the arms of the Chorus.)
14416: 
14417: Chorus
14418: 
14419: Silence! Silence!
14420: False-seeing one, false-speaking one, you!
14421: Out of the terrible single-toothed
14422: Mouth, what might be breathed, so,                     8885
14423: Out of so frightful a throat of horror!
14424: Now the malevolent, seemingly benevolent,
14425: Wolf’s anger under the woolly fleece,
14426: Is more terrible to me than the jaws
14427: Of the three-headed dog.                               8890
14428: We stand here anxiously listening:
14429: When? How? Where, will such malice
14430: Break out now
14431: From this predatory monster?
14432: 
14433: Now rather than friendly words, richly laced           8895
14434: With trust, waters of Lethe, sweet and mild,
14435: You stir up all from the past,
14436: The evil more than the good,
14437: And instantly darken
14438: The gleam of the present                                                 8900
14439: And also the future’s
14440: Sweetly glimmering, hopeful dawn.
14441: 
14442: Silence! Silence!
14443: So the Queen’s spirit, now,
14444: Almost ready to leave her,                                               8905
14445: Can still hold, and uphold
14446: This, the form of all forms
14447: On which the sun ever lighted.
14448: 
14449: (Helen has recovered, and stands in the centre again.)
14450: 
14451: Phorkyas
14452: 
14453: Shining out from fleeting vapours, comes the sunlight of our day, here,
14454: That when veiled could so delight us, but in splendour only blinds us. 8910
14455: As the world is open to you, when you show your lovely face, now,
14456: Though they scorn me so as ugly, still I know the beautiful.
14457: 
14458: Helen
14459: 
14460: I step, trembling, from the abyss that, in fainting, closed around me,
14461: And would gladly rest my body, tired and weary are my limbs:
14462: But it’s proper for a Queen, then, as it is for all about her,           8915
14463: To be calm, and courageous, whatever harm shall threaten.
14464: 
14465: Phorkyas
14466: 
14467: In your Majesty, and Beauty, standing here, now, before us,
14468: Your look says it commands us. What do you command? Speak out.
14469: 
14470: Helen
14471: 
14472: Prepare yourselves to atone for what your quarrel has neglected:
14473: Hurry with your sacrifice, now, as the king himself commanded.           8920
14474: 
14475: 
14476: Phorkyas
14477: All is ready in the palace, bowls, and tripods, sharpened axe-blade,
14478: For the sprinkling, incense burning: show me now the ready victim!
14479: 
14480: Helen
14481: 
14482: That the king has failed to tell me.
14483: 
14484: Phorkyas
14485: 
14486:                                   He said nothing? Words of woe!
14487: 
14488: Helen
14489: 
14490: What’s this woe that overcomes you?
14491: 
14492: Phorkyas
14493: 
14494:                            Queen, it means you must be slaughtered!
14495: 
14496: Helen
14497: 
14498: I?
14499: 
14500: Phorkyas
14501: 
14502:         And them.
14503: 
14504: Chorus
14505: 
14506:              Oh, pain and suffering!
14507: 
14508: Phorkyas
14509: 
14510:                                         You will fall beneath the axe.   8925
14511: 
14512: 
14513: Helen
14514: 
14515: Presaged, though still dreadful: I, alas!
14516: Phorkyas
14517: 
14518:                                               There’s no escaping.
14519: 
14520: Chorus
14521: 
14522: Oh! And us? What happens to us?
14523: 
14524: Phorkyas
14525: 
14526:                                        She will die a noble death, then:
14527: But you’ll hang in rows together, struggling, all along the rafters
14528: Holding up the gabled roof there, as bird-catchers dangle thrushes.
14529: 
14530: (Helena and the Chorus stand stunned and alarmed, in striking composed
14531: groups.)
14532: 
14533: Phantoms! – Frozen images, you stand, parted                               8930
14534: From that light you can’t belong to, in your terror.
14535: Men, and the tribe of phantoms you resemble,
14536: Will never willingly forgo the sunlight:
14537: But none are saved from their fate, or can defer it.
14538: All know it’s true, but only a few accept it.                              8935
14539: Enough, you’re lost! Now, quickly: start the work.
14540: 
14541: (She claps her hands: muffled dwarfish forms appear in the doorway, and
14542: quickly carry out her orders.)
14543: 
14544: This way, you spheres, shadowy rounded forms!
14545: Roll over here: and do what harm you wish.
14546: Set up the gold-horned altar that you carry,
14547: Let the gleaming axe lie there on the silver rim,                          8940
14548: Fill the urns with water to wash away
14549: All the hideous stains of darkened blood.
14550: Spread the rich carpets out, here, over the dust,
14551: So the sacrifice can kneel in royal manner,
14552: And be wrapped around, once the head is severed,                       8945
14553: And buried decently there, and with due honour.
14554: The Leader of the Chorus
14555: 
14556: The Queen stands here beside us deep in thought,
14557: The maidservants wither away like mown grass:
14558: I think that I, as the eldest, am bound, in sacred duty,
14559: To barter words with you, the eldest of all by far.                 8950
14560: You’re wise, experienced, and seem well-disposed,
14561: And though this foolish crowd baited you in error,
14562: Speak of a way to escape this fate, if you know it.
14563: 
14564: Phorkyas
14565: 
14566: That’s easily done: it depends on the Queen alone,
14567: To save herself, and you her followers with her.                    8955
14568: But decision is required, and of the swiftest.
14569: 
14570: Chorus
14571: 
14572: Most honoured of Fates, wisest of Sibyls, you,
14573: Hold the gold shears apart: bring both aid and light:
14574: Already, we feel ourselves swinging, struggling,
14575: Fearful, for our limbs would rather be dancing,                     8960
14576: And afterwards rest, soft, on our lovers’ breast.
14577: 
14578: Helen
14579: 
14580: Let them be afraid! I feel pain but no terror:
14581: Yet if rescue’s possible, I gladly accept.
14582: To the wise, far-seeing mind, the impossible
14583: Is often revealed as possible. Speak: say on!                       8965
14584: 
14585: Chorus
14586: 
14587: Speak, and tell us, tell us quickly: how we might escape the terror,
14588: Dreadful nooses that still threaten, like some kind of evil necklace
14589: Wound around our tender necks? Already we, oh, wretched creatures,
14590: Feel the choking, suffocating, if you, Rhea, the great mother
14591: Of the gods, won’t show us mercy.                                    8970
14592: Phorkyas
14593: 
14594: Have you the patience to listen, to long winded
14595: Speeches, in silence? The history’s endless.
14596: 
14597: Chorus
14598: 
14599: Patience enough! While we’re listening, we’re alive.
14600: 
14601: Phorkyas
14602: 
14603: He who stays at home to guard his noble wealth
14604: And secures the high walls of his lofty dwelling,        8975
14605: And maintains his roof against the driving rain,
14606: Will prosper in all the days of his long life:
14607: But whoever, in guilt, crosses the square-cut stones
14608: Of the sacred threshold, swiftly, with fleeing steps,
14609: Will, indeed find the ancient place, on their return,    8980
14610: But altered in every way, if not overthrown.
14611: 
14612: Helen
14613: 
14614: Why recount these familiar sayings here?
14615: If you’d relate things: don’t provoke annoyance.
14616: 
14617: Phorkyas
14618: 
14619: It’s simple fact, in no way a criticism.
14620: Menelaus sailed from bay to bay, looting,                8985
14621: Skirted the coast and islands, aggressively,
14622: Returned with the spoils that are rusting there.
14623: Then he spent ten long years there in front of Troy:
14624: And I don’t know how many more, on the way home.
14625: And how are things now with this place where we stand,   8990
14626: Tyndareus’ noble house, and the region round?
14627: 
14628: Helen
14629: 
14630: Do you embrace all scorn so completely
14631: You can only open your mouth to criticise?
14632: Phorkyas
14633: 
14634: The vales were neglected for so many years,
14635: Those that rise behind Sparta, to the northward,        8995
14636: Beyond Taygetus, from where, a living stream,
14637: Eurotas, pours downward, then along our valley,
14638: Flows by our broad reed-beds, to feed your swans.
14639: Up there, in the mountain vales, a bold race settled,
14640: Pushing southward from Cimmerian darkness,              9000
14641: And then built an inaccessible fortress there,
14642: From which, at will, they harass land and people.
14643: 
14644: Helen
14645: 
14646: Have they achieved all that? It seems unlikely.
14647: 
14648: Phorkyas
14649: 
14650: They’ve had time, perhaps twenty years in all.
14651: 
14652: Helena
14653: 
14654: Is there a leader? Are they a band of robbers?          9005
14655: 
14656: Phorkyas
14657: 
14658: Not robbers, but one of them acts as leader.
14659: I don’t curse him, though he attacked me too.
14660: He might have taken all, but was satisfied
14661: With gifts, not tribute, as he called them.
14662: 
14663: Helen
14664: 
14665: How did he look?
14666: 
14667: Phorkyas
14668: 
14669:         Less than evil! He pleased me well.             9010
14670: He’s vigorous, daring, and sophisticated,
14671: An intelligent man: as few among the Greeks.
14672: They call his race Barbarians, but I’m doubtful
14673: If they are any crueller than those heroes
14674: Who proved such devourers of men, before Troy.          9015
14675: I respected his greatness, and confided in him.
14676: His fortress! You should see with your own eyes!
14677: It’s a great deal more than the clumsy masonry
14678: Your father rolled together, higgledy-piggledy,
14679: Cyclopean as a Cyclops, piling raw stone,               9020
14680: Over raw stone: there, instead there, it’s all
14681: Plumb line and balance: it’s laid out by rule.
14682: Look from outside! It rises straight to the sky,
14683: So firm, tightly jointed – smooth as a steel mirror
14684: To climb – that even your thoughts slide off!           9025
14685: And, inside, great courts with plenty of room,
14686: Ringed by buildings, of every use and nature.
14687: There you’ll see pillars, columns, arches, quoins,
14688: Balconies, galleries, facing inwards and outwards,
14689: And coats of arms.
14690: 
14691: Chorus
14692: 
14693:                    What arms are those?
14694: 
14695: Phorkyas
14696: 
14697:                                          Ajax carried   9030
14698: A writhing snake on his shield: you yourself saw it.
14699: The Seven against Thebes also bore their symbols
14700: On each of their shields, replete with meaning.
14701: There you saw moons, and stars in the night sky,
14702: Heroes and Goddesses, torches, ladders, swords,         9035
14703: And whatever fierce weapons threaten fine cities.
14704: Our heroic band carries such images too,
14705: In bright colours, bestowed by our ancestors.
14706: There you see lions, eagles with beaks and claws,
14707: Horns of oxen, wings, roses, and peacocks’ tails,       9040
14708: Bands too made of gold, black, silver, blue and red.
14709: The like of these hang in their halls, row on row.
14710: In spacious halls, as wide as the whole wide world:
14711: You could dance there!
14712: 
14713: Chorus
14714: 
14715:                  Say then, are there dancers, there?
14716: 
14717: Phorkyas
14718: 
14719: The best! A lively crowd of golden-haired youths.       9045
14720: The fragrance of youth! Paris was fragrant, thus,
14721: When he grew close to the Queen.
14722: 
14723: Helen
14724: 
14725:                         You mistake your role
14726: Completely: now speak your closing lines to me!
14727: 
14728: Phorkyas
14729: 
14730: No, you speak the last! Grave, and distinct say: Yes!
14731: And I’ll surround you with that fortress.
14732: 
14733: Chorus
14734: 
14735:                                          O, speak       9050
14736: That one short word, and save both yourself, and us!
14737: 
14738: Helen
14739: 
14740: What? Do I fear King Menelaus would commit
14741: Such a cruel offence as to make me kill myself?
14742: 
14743: Phorkyas
14744: 
14745: Have you forgotten how he wreaked mutilation,
14746: Unheard-of, on Deiphobus, dead Paris’ brother,          9055
14747: Because he stubbornly claimed you, the widow,
14748: And prized you? He cropped both nose and ears,
14749: And disfigured him, there: It was terrible to see.
14750: Helen
14751: 
14752: Yes he did that, and he did it for my sake.
14753: 
14754: Phorkyas
14755: 
14756: Because of it, now, he’ll do the same to you.                        9060
14757: Beauty is indivisible: he who owns it
14758: Destroys it, rather than share a part of it.
14759: 
14760: (Trumpets sound in the distance: the Chorus starts in terror.)
14761: 
14762: As a trumpet call pierces the ear to grip
14763: And tear the innards: Jealousy drives her claws
14764: Into the breast of him who can never forget                          9065
14765: What once he had, and lost, and no longer has.
14766: 
14767: Chorus
14768: 
14769: Don’t you hear the trumpets calling? Don’t you see the flash of swords?
14770: 
14771: Phorkyas
14772: 
14773: King and master, now be welcome, gladly I’ll offer my account.
14774: 
14775: Chorus
14776: 
14777: But, what of us?
14778: 
14779: Phorkyas
14780: 
14781:              In truth, you know that her death’s before your eyes,
14782: Find your own death there within them: there’s no hope left for you. 9070
14783: 
14784: (A Pause.)
14785: 
14786: Helen
14787: 
14788: I ponder this simple thing that I might try.
14789: You are a hostile daemon: I feel it deeply,
14790: I’m fearful you’ll still make evil out of good.
14791: But then, I’ll follow you to that fortress, there:
14792: I know the rest: but what the Queen might conceal                    9075
14793: Concerning it, mysteriously, in her heart,
14794: Be unknown to all. Now, old one, lead the way!
14795: 
14796: Chorus
14797: 
14798: O, how gladly we’re going,
14799: On hurrying feet:
14800: Death is behind:                                                     9080
14801: Before us again,
14802: Towering fortress
14803: Inaccessible walls.
14804: Though they guard us as well
14805: As Ilium’s citadel,                                                  9085
14806: Still in the end, it
14807: Fell, through the basest of ruses.
14808: 
14809: (Mists rise and spread, obscuring the background, and the nearer part of the
14810: scene, at will.)
14811: 
14812: What is this? How?
14813: Sisters, look round!
14814: Wasn’t it loveliest day?                                             9090
14815: Strips of vapour hover about,
14816: Rise from Eurotas’ holy stream:
14817: Already the loveliest
14818: Reed-wreathed shore has vanished from sight:
14819: And the proud, free, graceful                                        9095
14820: Gentle glide of the swans
14821: Swimming in sociable joy,
14822: I alas see, no more!
14823: 
14824: Yet still, still
14825: I hear them calling,                                                 9100
14826: In hoarse tones, calling afar!
14827: Proclaiming death, they are speaking.
14828: Ah, that to us they may not,
14829: Instead of salvation promised,
14830: Proclaim our ruin, at last:                                          9105
14831: To us, the swanlike, long,
14832: Lovely, white-throated, and ah!
14833: Our Queen born of the swan.
14834: Woe to us, woe!
14835: 
14836: All’s hidden already                                                 9110
14837: Vapour’s swirling around.
14838: Now we can’t see one another!
14839: What’s happening? Are we moving?
14840: 
14841: 
14842: We’re hovering with
14843: Straggling steps along the ground?                                   9115
14844: Can’t you see? Isn’t that Hermes
14845: Soaring ahead? Doesn’t his gold wand gleam,
14846: Beckoning us, ordering us back again
14847: To the wholly joyless, and greyly-twilit,
14848: Intangible, phantom-filled,                                          9120
14849: Overcrowded, ever-empty Hades?
14850: 
14851: Yes, at once, now, all is darkening, dully all the vapours vanish,
14852: Grey with gloom, and brown as walls. Walls appearing to our vision,
14853: Blank now to our clearer vision. A court now is it? Or a deep pit?
14854: Fearful, though, in either case, now! Sisters, oh! We are imprisoned, 9125
14855: Captives, as we’ve never been.
14856: Part II Act III Scene II: The Inner Court of The Castle
14857: 
14858: (Surrounded with richly ornamented buildings of the Middle Ages.)
14859: 
14860: The Leader of the Chorus
14861: 
14862: Hasty and foolish, and typical of womankind!
14863: They hang on the moment, sport of every breeze,
14864: Of every chance and mischance, never knowing
14865: How to suffer either calmly! One’s always certain,                  9130
14866: Fiercely, to contradict the others, others her:
14867: Only, they laugh or cry alike, in joy or pain.
14868: Now, hush! And listen to what our high-minded
14869: Mistress may decide, here, for herself and us.
14870: 
14871: Helen
14872: 
14873: Pythoness, where are you? However you’re named:                     9135
14874: Come out from the arches of this dark fortress.
14875: If you come from the wondrous lord and hero
14876: To announce me, and ready a fit reception,
14877: Accept my thanks, and lead me there quickly:
14878: I wish my wanderings ended. I want to rest.                         9140
14879: 
14880: The Leader of the Chorus
14881: 
14882: Queen, in vain, you look about in all directions:
14883: That wretched shape has vanished, stayed perhaps
14884: There in the vapour, out of whose depths we came,
14885: I cannot tell how, so swiftly, without a footfall.
14886: Perhaps she wanders lost in the vast labyrinth                      9145
14887: Of these many castles wondrously merged in one.
14888: Seeking high and princely greeting from her lord.
14889: But see! There a crowd moves about in readiness.
14890: Along galleries, at windows, through the doors
14891: Come a crowd of servants, scurrying to and fro:                     9150
14892: It proclaims a noblest welcome for the guest.
14893: Chorus
14894: 
14895: My heart is eased! O, see over there,
14896: How a company of handsome youths approach
14897: With lingering step, in dignified order,
14898: Marching in ranks. Who gave out the command                          9155
14899: To marshal them, and so quickly arranged
14900: All this youthful team of so handsome a race?
14901: What shall I admire most? Is it the graceful step,
14902: Or the curls of hair on the palest of brows,
14903: Or the rounded cheeks with a peach’s blushes,                        9160
14904: And like it also, in their silkiest down?
14905: I’d gladly bite, yet I’m frightened to try it:
14906: Since in a similar case, and I shudder to say it,
14907: The mouth was as suddenly filled, with ashes!
14908: 
14909: But the handsomest                                                   9165
14910: Come to us now:
14911: What do they carry?
14912: Steps for the throne,
14913: Carpets and seat,
14914: Curtain, canopy,                                                     9170
14915: Jewelled finery:
14916: Waving above us,
14917: Forming a garland,
14918: Over the head of our Queen:
14919: For she, already, invited                                            9175
14920: Ascends, to the noble seat.
14921: Forward now,
14922: Step by step,
14923: Solemnly ranked.
14924: Worthy, O worthy, triply worthy,                                     9180
14925: Let such a reception be blessed!
14926: 
14927: (What the Chorus has described takes place. After the boys and squires have
14928: descended in long procession, Faust appears above, at the top of the
14929: staircase, in the costume of a knight of the Middle Ages, and then descends
14930: slowly and with dignity.)
14931: The Leader of the Chorus (Observing him closely.)
14932: 
14933: If indeed the gods have not, as they often do,
14934: Only lent this man brave form, for an instant,
14935: Exalted his dignity, and charming presence,
14936: As a temporary act, then whatever he does           9185
14937: He’ll succeed, whether it’s warring with men,
14938: Or in the lesser struggles with lovely ladies.
14939: Truly I prefer him to hosts of others,
14940: Whom my eyes have seen, the highly praised.
14941: I see the Prince approach, with slow solemn step,   9190
14942: Restrained by reverence: Queen, turn towards him!
14943: 
14944: Faust (Approaching: a man in chains at his side.)
14945: 
14946: Instead of the usual calm greeting
14947: Instead of a reverential welcome,
14948: Here I bring a wretch bound fast with chains,
14949: Who failed so in his duty, I failed mine.           9195
14950: Kneel here, so this noble lady
14951: May hear a prompt confession of your guilt.
14952: This, royal Mistress, is the man selected
14953: Because of his keen vision to gaze about
14954: From the high tower, and to look keenly
14955: At heaven’s spaces, and the breadth of earth,       9200
14956: To report whatever moves here or there,
14957: From the encircling hills, to the castle,
14958: Whether a transit of the woolly flocks,
14959: Or soldiers: so we can protect the first,
14960: Attack the others. Today, negligence!               9205
14961: You came here: he had nothing to report:
14962: We failed in the reception you deserved,
14963: In honour of the guest. Now he forfeits
14964: His guilty life, and would have shed his blood      9210
14965: In a merited death: but only you alone
14966: Shall pardon him or punish, as you wish.
14967: Helen
14968: 
14969: Such great power you choose to grant me,
14970: As judge, as Mistress too, though, I suspect
14971: You intend it as a kind of test –              9215
14972: Yet, I’ll employ a judge’s first duty,
14973: To give the accused a hearing. Speak out.
14974: 
14975: Lynceus, the Warden of the Tower
14976: 
14977: Let me kneel, and let me see her,
14978: Let me live, or let me die,
14979: Already I’m devoted to her                     9220
14980: Heavenly lady from on high.
14981: 
14982: Waiting for the dawn’s advances,
14983: Gazing at her eastern house,
14984: Suddenly the sunlight dances,
14985: Marvellously in the south!                     9225
14986: 
14987: Drawn to see the marvel closer,
14988: Instead of the ravine and height,
14989: Instead of earth and heaven there,
14990: I gazed at her, the sole delight.
14991: 
14992: I was granted powers of vision                 9230
14993: Like the lynx, high in the tree:
14994: But now I peered in indecision
14995: As in a dark and clouded dream.
14996: 
14997: How think? Even if I’d so wished?
14998: Wall, and tower? Bolted gate?                  9235
14999: Mist, it rose, and cleared the mist,
15000: Came the Goddess here in state!
15001: I surrendered heart and eye
15002: Drinking in the gentle light:
15003: How that beauty blinds, and I                     9240
15004: Was blinded wholly by the sight.
15005: 
15006: I forgot the watchman’s duty,
15007: And the promised trumpet call:
15008: Threaten then, now, to destroy me –
15009: Anger lies in Beauty’s thrall.                    9245
15010: 
15011: Helen
15012: 
15013: I cannot punish this evil that I brought here,
15014: With me. Ah me! What a fierce fate it is
15015: Pursues me, so that everywhere I possess
15016: The hearts of men, and that they neither spare
15017: Themselves nor anything else of worth.            9250
15018: They steal, seduce, fight: rushing to and fro,
15019: Demigods, heroes, gods, even daemons
15020: Led me in my wanderings, here and there.
15021: Alone I’ve confused the world, doubly so:
15022: Now I bring threefold, fourfold woe on woe.       9255
15023: Take this innocent away: let him go.
15024: It’s no shame to be deceived by the gods.
15025: 
15026: Faust
15027: 
15028: O Queen, amazed, I see them both together:
15029: The certain archer, and the stricken prey:
15030: I see the bow, from which the shaft was loosed,   9260
15031: That wounded him. Arrow after arrow,
15032: Now strikes me. Imagining the feathered whirr
15033: Of arrows crossing every court and hall.
15034: What am I now? My walls you make unsafe
15035: My most faithful servants, you make rebels,       9265
15036: Already I fear my army too obeys
15037: A victorious and unconquered lady.
15038: What’s left to do but add myself as well,
15039: And all that I have vainly imagined mine?
15040: Freely and loyally, before your feet,             9270
15041: Let me acknowledge you as Mistress,
15042: Whose presence wins you throne and ownership.
15043: 
15044: Lynceus (Carrying a chest, with men bringing others.)
15045: 
15046: Queen, once more I advance!
15047: The rich man begs a glance,
15048: He sees you and at a glimpse,                           9275
15049: He’s a beggar, and a prince.
15050: 
15051: What am I now? What was I once?
15052: What’s to be willed? What’s to be done?
15053: What use the eye’s clearest sight!
15054: It glances from your royal might.                       9280
15055: 
15056: From the Eastwards we pressed on,
15057: And suddenly the West were gone.
15058: So wide and long the people massed,
15059: The first knew nothing of the last.
15060: 
15061: The first rank fell: the next stood fast,               9285
15062: The third ranks’ lances unsurpassed:
15063: Each man was like a hundredfold,
15064: Thousands died there, all untold.
15065: 
15066: We pressed forwards: we stormed on,
15067: We were masters, then were gone:                        9290
15068: And where I ruled as chief today,
15069: Tomorrow robbed, and stole away.
15070: 
15071: We looked – and rapid was that look:
15072: The loveliest women there we took,
15073: We took the oxen from the stall,                        9295
15074: We took the horses, took them all.
15075: 
15076: But my delight was to discover
15077: The rarest things I could uncover:
15078: And what other men might grasp,
15079: To me was only withered grass.                          9300
15080: I was on the trail of treasure,
15081: Whatever my sharp eye could measure,
15082: In every pocket I could see,
15083: Every chest was glass to me.
15084: 
15085: Heaps of gold, they were mine,            9305
15086: And the noblest gems I’d find:
15087: Yet now the emeralds alone
15088: Are worthy to adorn your throne.
15089: 
15090: Sway there now ‘twixt ear and lip,
15091: You pearly spheres from oceans deep:      9310
15092: A place the rubies dare not seek,
15093: So pale beside your rosy cheek.
15094: 
15095: And so the riches, every prize,
15096: I set down here before your eyes:
15097: Before your feet I gladly yield,          9315
15098: The spoils of many a bloody field.
15099: 
15100: As many chests as I’ve brought you,
15101: I’ve many iron caskets too:
15102: Let me follow your path still
15103: And your treasure chambers fill.          9320
15104: 
15105: You’d scarcely mounted to the throne,
15106: When all bowed down, to you alone,
15107: Wisdom, riches, worldly power,
15108: Before your grace, that very hour.
15109: 
15110: I held it all fast: that is true          9325
15111: But now it’s loosed, and all for you.
15112: I thought its worth was plain to see,
15113: But now it’s nothing much, to me.
15114: 
15115: Everything I’ve owned will pass
15116: From me like mown and withered grass.     9330
15117: O, give me just one brightening glance,
15118: And all the value’s in its dance!
15119: Faust
15120: 
15121: Quickly, remove the heap that boldness won,
15122: And take no blame for it, but seek no praise.
15123: All is hers already, that the castle            9335
15124: Hides in its lap: you offer these few things
15125: In vain. Go and pile treasure on treasure,
15126: In due order. Present a fine array
15127: Of unseen splendours! Let the vaulted halls
15128: Gleam like the clearest sky, let Paradise       9340
15129: Be created from their dead existence.
15130: Quickly let flowery carpet on carpet
15131: Be unrolled beneath her foot: she’ll step
15132: On softest ground: and let her noble gaze,
15133: Blinding all but the Gods, fall on splendour.   9345
15134: 
15135: Lynceus
15136: 
15137: What the lord commands is nothing,
15138: For the servants, a mere plaything:
15139: This exalted beauty rules
15140: Over blood and treasure too.
15141: The whole army now is tamed,                    9350
15142: All the swords are blunt again,
15143: Near this form of noble gold,
15144: The sun itself is pale and cold,
15145: Near the riches of her face
15146: All is but an empty space.                      9355
15147: 
15148: Helen (To Faust.)
15149: 
15150: I wish to speak to you, come here then
15151: Beside me! For the empty place invites
15152: Its lord, and so secures this place for me.
15153: Faust
15154: 
15155: First, let my loyal dedication please you,
15156: While I kneel, noble lady: let me kiss             9360
15157: The gracious hand that lifts me to your side.
15158: Confirm me as co-regent of a realm
15159: Of unknown borders, win now for yourself
15160: Protector, slave, worshipper all in one!
15161: 
15162: Helen
15163: 
15164: So many wonders do I see, and hear                 9365
15165: Amazement grips me, there’s much I would know.
15166: But teach me why that man spoke aloud
15167: With curious speech, familiar but strange.
15168: Each sound seeming to give way to the next,
15169: And when a word gave pleasure to the ear,          9370
15170: Another came, as if to caress the first.
15171: 
15172: Faust
15173: 
15174: If my people’s speech already pleases you,
15175: O, you’ll be delighted with our singing:
15176: It completely satisfies the heart and mind.
15177: But to be sure of it, we’ll practise too:          9375
15178: Alternate speech entices, calls it, forth.
15179: 
15180: Helen
15181: 
15182: You’ll tell me how to speak with lovely art?
15183: 
15184: Faust
15185: 
15186: It’s easy, it must pour forth from the heart.
15187: And if the breast then overflows with yearning,
15188: One looks around and asks –
15189: 
15190: Helen
15191: 
15192:                           - who else is burning.   9380
15193: Faust
15194: 
15195: Not backwards, forwards is the spirit’s sight,
15196: This moment now, alone, –
15197: 
15198: Helen
15199: 
15200:                              - is our delight.
15201: 
15202: Faust
15203: 
15204: She’s treasure and commitment, wealth and land:
15205: What confirmation does she give –
15206: 
15207: Helen
15208: 
15209: 
15210:                                         – my hand.
15211: 
15212: Chorus
15213: 
15214: Who’s offended that our Princess                     9385
15215: Grants the master of the castle
15216: A show of friendliness?
15217: Let’s confess, that we’re as fully
15218: Prisoners, as we’ve been till now
15219: Since the shameful overthrow                         9390
15220: Of Ilium, and the anxious,
15221: Sad, and labyrinthine voyage.
15222: 
15223: Women, used to men’s desires,
15224: Are not particular,
15225: They are proficient.                                 9395
15226: And they award an equal right
15227: To shepherds with their golden hair,
15228: Dark, fauns perhaps, bristling there,
15229: As opportunity affords,
15230: To bodies in their vigour.                           9400
15231: Already they sit closer, closer,
15232: Drawn towards each other,
15233: Shoulder to shoulder, knee to knee,
15234: Hand in hand they sway
15235: Across the thrones’                              9405
15236: Soft cushioned, majesty.
15237: Their private raptures
15238: Revealed so boldly
15239: To the eyes of the people.                       9410
15240: 
15241: Helen
15242: 
15243: I feel so far away and yet so near,
15244: And gladly say now: ‘Here, I am! Here!’
15245: 
15246: Faust
15247: 
15248: I scarcely breathe, I tremble, speech is dead:
15249: This is a dream: time and place have fled.
15250: 
15251: Helen
15252: 
15253: I seem exhausted, yet created new,               9415
15254: Enmeshed with you, the unknown and the true.
15255: 
15256: Faust
15257: 
15258: Don’t seek to analyse so rare a fate!
15259: Our duty is to live: though but a day.
15260: 
15261: Phorkyas (Entering suddenly.)
15262: 
15263: Spell the letters in love’s primer,
15264: Only loving, pass your time here,                9420
15265: Passing, let love be sublime here,
15266: But the moment isn’t right.
15267: Don’t you feel it, this dark presage?
15268: Don’t you hear the trumpet’s message?
15269: Your destruction is in sight.                    9425
15270: Menelaus with his army
15271: Is advancing on you quickly,
15272: Arm yourself, for bitter fight!
15273: Overwhelmed by the winners,
15274: And defiled, like Deiphobus,                                          9430
15275: You’ll all pay, for this delight.
15276: First the lighter vessels shatter,
15277: Then, for this one, at the altar,
15278: The newly sharpened axe shines bright.
15279: 
15280: Faust
15281: 
15282: Rash disturbance! Insistent, she comes pushing in here:               9435
15283: Senseless haste is wrong, even where there’s danger.
15284: Unlucky news makes the fairest messenger ugly:
15285: You, ugliest of all, bring only bad news gladly.
15286: But you’ll not succeed for once: disturb the air
15287: With your empty breath. There’s no danger looming here,               9440
15288: Your danger’s only an idle threat to me.
15289: 
15290: (Calls, and explosions from the towers, trumpets and cornets, martial music.
15291: A powerful army marches past.)
15292: 
15293: No! Now you’ll see the heroes gather,
15294: The whole wide land will here unite:
15295: He deserves the ladies’ favour,
15296: Who, in their defence, shall fight.                                   9445
15297: 
15298: (To the leaders, who step forward from the ranks, and advance.)
15299: 
15300: Rage silently, and do your duty,
15301: Then you’ll achieve the victory,
15302: You, the prime of northern beauty,
15303: You, the flower of the east.
15304: 
15305: Cased in steel, with steel gleaming,                                  9450
15306: The army shatters realms at will,
15307: They appear: the earth is shaking,
15308: They advance, it echoes still.
15309: At Pylos, once, we came to shore,
15310: Old Nestor is no longer living,                                      9455
15311: Our independent army saw
15312: Us shatter all the mighty kings.
15313: 
15314: From these walls, in an instant,
15315: Send Menelaus back to sea:
15316: There robbing, killing, is his errand,                               9460
15317: As is his wish and destiny.
15318: 
15319: Dukes, I greet you every one,
15320: Commanded by the Spartan Queen:
15321: At her feet lay vale and mountain,
15322: Win the kingdoms in between.                                         9465
15323: 
15324: Germans, with your walls and towers,
15325: Defend Corinth and her bays!
15326: Then Achaia’s hundred gorges
15327: I’ll trust to you, the Goths, always.
15328: 
15329: Let the Franks advance on Elis,                                      9470
15330: Messene, to the Saxons brave,
15331: Normans, hold the Argolis,
15332: Rule the shore: and rule the wave.
15333: 
15334: When everyone has his own land,
15335: At foreign foes, let force be aimed,                                 9475
15336: While Sparta holds the high command
15337: Our Queen’s ancestral domain.
15338: 
15339: She’ll behold you each, delighting
15340: In lands, possessed of every right:
15341: And at her feet you’ll seek her blessing,                            9480
15342: Acknowledgement, and law and light.
15343: 
15344: (Faust descends from the throne: the Princes form a circle round him to
15345: receive individual commands and instructions.)
15346: Chorus
15347: 
15348: Who wants the loveliest for himself,
15349: First, above everything,
15350: Would be wise to have weapons about him:
15351: He might well gain by flattery                  9485
15352: Whoever is noblest on Earth:
15353: But he won’t possess her in peace:
15354: The sly, and insidious tempt her from him,
15355: Robbers will boldly steal her from him:
15356: He must prepare to foil them.                   9490
15357: 
15358: So I praise our Prince the while,
15359: And think him nobler than the rest,
15360: Since he combines wisdom and strength,
15361: So that the powerful show obedience,
15362: Waiting his every command.                      9495
15363: They follow his orders faithfully,
15364: Each as much for his own profit
15365: As for the ruler’s reward and thanks,
15366: Winning the highest fame for both.
15367: 
15368: Who now will drag her away                      9500
15369: From the powerful possessor?
15370: She belongs to him: let her be his,
15371: Doubly bestowed by us, so she
15372: And he, are surrounded inside by thick walls,
15373: Outside, by the greatest of armies.             9505
15374: 
15375: Faust
15376: 
15377: The gifts that, on those here, I bestow –
15378: To each of them a prosperous land –
15379: Are great and glorious, let them go!
15380: We in the middle take our stand.
15381: 
15382: In their rivalry they’ll protect you            9510
15383: Half-island ringed by leaping waves,
15384: While these slender hills connect you
15385: To Europe’s last great mountain range.
15386: This land, that outshines every land,
15387: Be blessed for every race forever,                   9515
15388: Delivered to my Queen’s command,
15389: That, long ago now, wondered at her,
15390: 
15391: There, by Eurotas’ whispering light,
15392: She broke radiant from the shell,
15393: That brightness dazzling the sight                   9520
15394: Of siblings: Leda’s eyes, as well.
15395: 
15396: This land now turns to you alone,
15397: Offering you its noblest flower:
15398: Oh, though the whole world is your own,
15399: Let your country hold you in its power!              9525
15400: 
15401: And though you may endure the sun’s cold arrow
15402: Up there, on the mountain’s jagged height,
15403: See, how the rocky hillside’s green below, now,
15404: Where the goat may crop its meagre right.
15405: 
15406: The sources leap, all streams rush down as one,      9530
15407: Gorge, slope, and meadow are already green.
15408: On a hundred hills, rock-folded, steep and broken,
15409: The scattered woolly flocks are clearly seen.
15410: 
15411: Spread all around, with cautious measured stride,
15412: The horned cattle tread the dizzy edge:              9535
15413: But here there’s shelter that the caves provide,
15414: Hundreds to hide them all, on the rocky ledge.
15415: 
15416: Pan guards them too: and lively nymphs live there,
15417: In the damp fresh space of bushy clefts,
15418: And, yearning upward to the higher air,              9540
15419: The crowded tree its slender branches lifts.
15420: Primeval woods! The mighty oaks their cap:
15421: Whose stubborn boughs stick out from them, in state:
15422: While kindly maples, pregnant with sweet sap,
15423: Soar cleanly upward, toying with the weight.           9545
15424: 
15425: Pure mother’s milk, in that still realm of shadows,
15426: Flows rich, in readiness for lamb and child:
15427: Fruit’s not lacking, gift of fertile meadows,
15428: And from the hollow trunk drips honey mild.
15429: 
15430: Here well-being’s granted all the race,                9550
15431: Cheek and lips both to joy consent,
15432: Each one is immortal, in their place:
15433: And all there are healthy and content.
15434: 
15435: And thus the lovely child, of purest days,
15436: Grows, and achieves his father’s strength.             9555
15437: We’re amazed, the question’s still, always:
15438: Are these gods, or are they truly men?
15439: 
15440: When Apollo took a shepherd’s form,
15441: The fairest of them was like the sun:
15442: Since, where pure Nature is the norm,                  9560
15443: Then all the worlds must move as one.
15444: 
15445: (Taking his seat beside her.)
15446: 
15447: So, this have you, and this have I achieved:
15448: Let the past fade behind us: it is gone!
15449: Oh, know yourself from highest gods conceived,
15450: To the first world, alone then, you belong.            9565
15451: 
15452: No solid fortresses shall ring you round!
15453: In eternal youth, stands as it stood –
15454: So our stay with all delight be crowned –
15455: Arcadia in Sparta’s neighbourhood.
15456: Lured here to tread this blessed ground,                               9570
15457: You fled towards a happy destiny!
15458: Let our thrones as arbours now be found,
15459: Our joy be Arcadian, and free!
15460: 
15461: (The scene is completely transformed. Bowers are built against a range of
15462: rocky caverns. A shadowy grove runs to the foot of the rocks that rise on all
15463: sides. Faust and Helen are not visible: the Chorus lie scattered about in
15464: sleep.)
15465: 
15466: Phorkyas
15467: 
15468: I’m not sure how long these women have been sleeping:
15469: Nor do I know whether they allowed themselves                          9575
15470: To dream what I saw clearly with my own eyes.
15471: Therefore I’ll wake them. The young will be amazed,
15472: You bearded ones, too, who sit waiting there, below,
15473: To understand the meaning of these wonders.
15474: Wake! Wake, and shake the dew from your hair,                          9580
15475: The slumber from your eyes! Don’t blink so, but hear me!
15476: 
15477: Chorus
15478: 
15479: Tell us, quickly, quickly, all the wonders that have happened!
15480: If we can’t believe them, we’ll enjoy them with more pleasure.
15481: For we’re wholly weary sitting, staring at these empty stones.
15482: 
15483: Phorkyas
15484: 
15485: You’ve hardly rubbed your eyes, yet you’re already weary, children? 9585
15486: Well, listen: in these caverns, in these grottos, in these arbours,
15487: Shade and shelter have been granted, to the two idyllic lovers,
15488: Our Master and our Mistress.
15489: 
15490: Chorus
15491: 
15492:                           What, within there?
15493: 
15494: Phorkyas
15495:                                                         Sweetly sundered,
15496: From the world, alone they summoned me to grant them quiet service.
15497: At their side I stood there, honoured, yet still, as one who’s trusted, 9590
15498: Always gazed at something other, turning here and there at random.
15499: Looked for roots and bark and mosses, being skilled in all the potions,
15500: And so they were left alone.
15501: 
15502: Chorus
15503: 
15504: You speak as if a whole world’s space were hidden there inside, now,
15505: Woods and fields and lakes and rivers: what a fantasy you spin!      9595
15506: 
15507: Phorkyas
15508: 
15509: It’s true: you’re inexperienced, and its depths are unexplored!
15510: I felt, lost in contemplation, hall on hall there, court on court.
15511: In an instant laughter echoes, through the cavernous recesses:
15512: There I see a boy is springing, from his mother to his father,
15513: From his father to his mother, all is dandling and caressing,            9600
15514: And a foolish, a fond teasing, shouts of play, and cries of joy,
15515: Alternate, there, and I’m deaf.
15516: A naked wingless Spirit, like a faun, and yet no creature,
15517: Leaps across the solid floor, and the ground beneath responding,
15518: Sends him flying through the ether, till the second leap or so, there, 9605
15519: He can touch the cavern roof.
15520: Anxiously his mother’s calling: ‘Leap as often as you like, dear,
15521: But all flying is forbidden, so beware of taking flight.’
15522: And his loyal father warns him: ‘In the earth’s the power of swiftness,
15523: That will quickly send you flying: touch the ground then with your toe, 9610
15524: And like that son of Earth’s, Antaeus, you’ll soon find strength again.’
15525: So he leaps the rocky masses of the cavern, from a cornice,
15526: To another and around then, as a ball does when it’s thrown.
15527: But suddenly he’s vanished in a crevice of the cavern,
15528: And it seems he’s lost. His mother grieves for him, father comforts, 9615
15529: I stand there, wondering anxiously, but there again’s the vision!
15530: Do buried treasures lie there? Robes embroidered all with flowers,
15531: He has fittingly assumed.
15532: Tassels tremble from his shoulders, ribbons flutter round his chest,
15533: In his hand a golden lyre, like a miniature Apollo,                      9620
15534: He steps happily to the overhanging brink: amazing.
15535: And the parents in delight clasp each other to their hearts,
15536: What’s that shining round his temples? It’s hard to see what’s gleaming,
15537: Is it gold and gems, or flames, now, of the spirit’s supreme power?
15538: So he moves as if the stately boy’s proclaimed to us already          9625
15539: The future Lord of Beauty, in whose members the eternal
15540: Melodies are stirring: and so you too will also hear him,
15541: And you too will also see him, with the rarest show of wonder.
15542: 
15543: Chorus
15544: 
15545: Do you call this a marvel,
15546: Crete has begotten?                                                  9630
15547: Can you never have listened
15548: To what Poetry teaches?
15549: Have you never once heard Ionia’s,
15550: Have you never listened to Hellas’
15551: Most ancient of legends                                              9635
15552: Of the gods and heroes?
15553: 
15554: All things that happen
15555: In this present age,
15556: Are mournful echoes
15557: Of our ancestors’ nobler times:                                      9640
15558: And your story can’t equal
15559: That, loveliest of lies,
15560: Easier to believe than Truth,
15561: That they sang of Maia’s son.
15562: 
15563: That delicate and strong, yet                                        9645
15564: Scarcely born, suckling child,
15565: Would you swaddle him in purest down,
15566: Clothe him in costly jewelled bindings,
15567: The crowd of chattering nurses’
15568: Utterly senseless notion.                                            9650
15569: 
15570: But strong and yet delicate,
15571: Already the supple rascal,
15572: Draws forth his lithe body,
15573: Leaves behind that royal,
15574: But timid, constraining shell,                                       9655
15575: Silent, there, in its place:
15576: 
15577: Like the finished butterfly,
15578: From the chilly chrysalis,
15579: Slipping, with quick unfolding wings,
15580: Boldly into the sunlit air,                                         9660
15581: And courageously fluttering.
15582: So did he, the liveliest,
15583: 
15584: And he quickly demonstrated
15585: By the most skilful arts,
15586: That he’d always be the patron                                      9665
15587: Daemon of thieves and jesters
15588: And all seekers of profit.
15589: 
15590: From the Sea God he quickly stole
15591: His trident, and from Ares himself,
15592: Slyly, his sword from its scabbard:                                 9670
15593: Bow and arrows from Phoebus too,
15594: And tongs from Hephaestus:
15595: 
15596: He even stole Father Zeus’
15597: Lightning bolts, not scared of fire:
15598: Then he tripped poor Eros up,                                       9675
15599: In the toils of a wrestling match:
15600: As Venus kissed him, too, stole away,
15601: The ribbons from her breasts.
15602: 
15603: (A pure melodious and exquisite music echoes from the cave. All listen and
15604: appear deeply moved. There is a full musical accompaniment from this point
15605: to the designated pause.)
15606: Phorkyas
15607: 
15608: Hear the loveliest of music,
15609: Free from old mythology!                                         9680
15610: All your gods and all their antics,
15611: Let them go, they’re history.
15612: 
15613: None can understand you more,
15614: We demand a higher art:
15615: From the heart itself must pour,                                 9685
15616: What will influence the heart.
15617: 
15618: (She retires towards the rocks.)
15619: 
15620: Be you stirred, you awesome being,
15621: By the sweet and flattering sound,
15622: We, renewed to life, are feeling,
15623: Moved to tears of joy, around.                                   9690
15624: 
15625: Let the sun be lost from heaven
15626: So it’s daylight in the soul,
15627: We’ll discover in the heart, then,
15628: What the Earth fails to hold.
15629: 
15630: (Helen. Faust. Euphorion, in costume as previously described.)
15631: 
15632: Euphorion
15633: 
15634: Hear the song of childhood sung now,                             9695
15635: Its delight belongs to you,
15636: See me leap about in time, now
15637: Let my parents’ hearts leap too.
15638: 
15639: Helen
15640: 
15641: It requires two noble hearts
15642: For Love to bless humanity,                                      9700
15643: But to be a thing apart
15644: They must make a precious three.
15645: Faust
15646: 
15647: All we sought is now discovered:
15648: I am yours, and you are mine:
15649: And we two are bound together,     9705
15650: There’s no better fate to find.
15651: 
15652: Chorus
15653: 
15654: They’ll delight for many years
15655: In this child’s tender glow,
15656: Ah, this partnership of peers,
15657: How it’s beauty moves me, so!      9710
15658: 
15659: Euphorion
15660: 
15661: Now let me leap, oh,
15662: Now let me spring!
15663: High in the air, go
15664: Circling all things,
15665: That’s the desire                  9715
15666: That’s driving me on.
15667: 
15668: Faust
15669: 
15670: Yet, gently! Gently!
15671: Not into danger,
15672: Lest a chance downfall,
15673: Awaits the ranger,                 9720
15674: Straight away grounds you,
15675: Our darling son!
15676: 
15677: Euphorion
15678: 
15679: I can’t stick fast to
15680: The ground any more:
15681: Let go my hands and                9725
15682: Let go my hair,
15683: Let go my clothes!
15684: They are all mine.
15685: Helen
15686: 
15687: O think! Please think,
15688: Whom you belong to!                                                9730
15689: How it would grieve us,
15690: How you’d destroy too,
15691: That sweet achievement,
15692: Yours, his and mine.
15693: 
15694: Chorus
15695: 
15696: I fear this unity                                                  9735
15697: Soon will unwind!
15698: 
15699: Helen and Faust
15700: 
15701: Calm yourself! Calm excess,
15702: To please your parents,
15703: Too great a liveliness,
15704: Impulsive violence!                                                9740
15705: In rural peacefulness,
15706: Brighten the plain.
15707: 
15708: Euphorion
15709: 
15710: If that’s what you wish, yes,
15711: I’ll stop, I’ll restrain.
15712: 
15713: (He winds, dancing, through the chorus and draws them along with him.)
15714: 
15715: I’ll hover here, lightly                                           9745
15716: Lively the crew.
15717: Is this the melody,
15718: And measure too?
15719: Helen
15720: 
15721: Yes that is neatly done:
15722: Lead all the fairest on,                                              9750
15723: Through intricacy.
15724: 
15725: Faust
15726: 
15727: Would it were over then!
15728: Such entertainment
15729: Won’t delight me.
15730: 
15731: Chorus (With Euphorion, dancing nimbly and singing, in interlinking
15732: ranks.)
15733: 
15734: When your arms equally                                                9755
15735: Are charmingly lifted,
15736: Your curling hair’s brightly
15737: Loosened and shifted.
15738: 
15739: When with a foot so light
15740: Over the earth in flight,                                             9760
15741: Thither and back again,
15742: Step upon step, you rain,
15743: 
15744: Then your goal is in sight,
15745: Loveliest child:
15746: All of our hearts, beguiled,                                          9765
15747: With yours unite.
15748: 
15749: (Pause.)
15750: 
15751: Euphorion
15752: 
15753: You’re like so many
15754: Light-footed fawns:
15755: Now to new games we
15756: Are quickly re-born!                                                  9770
15757: I’ll be the hunter,
15758: You be the prey.
15759: Chorus
15760: 
15761: If you would catch us
15762: Don’t be so eager,
15763: We too are anxious                         9775
15764: When all is over,
15765: To clasp the form,
15766: You so sweetly display!
15767: 
15768: Euphorion
15769: 
15770: Now through the vale!
15771: Up hill and down dale!                     9780
15772: What I gain easily
15773: Is tedious to see,
15774: Only what’s forcibly
15775: Won delights me.
15776: 
15777: Helen and Faust
15778: 
15779: How wild he is now! And how stubborn!      9785
15780: There’s little hope of moderation.
15781: That’s the sound of blowing horns,
15782: Through the woods and valley ringing:
15783: What noise, and what confusion!
15784: 
15785: Chorus (Entering one by one, in haste.)
15786: 
15787: He is running from us swiftly:             9790
15788: Scorning us and always mocking,
15789: Now he drags one from the crowd: she,
15790: The wildest of us all.
15791: 
15792: Euphorion (Dragging along a young girl.)
15793: 
15794: Here I’ll drag the little quarry,
15795: To enforce my wish entirely:               9795
15796: For my joy, and my desire,
15797: Press her wilful heart, on fire,
15798: Kiss her stubborn mouth at length
15799: And proclaim my will and strength.
15800: 
15801: The Girl
15802: 
15803: Let me go! Since there’s a strong                9800
15804: Resistant spirit in this body:
15805: My will, like yours, if I’m not wrong,
15806: Says I’m not taken easily.
15807: 
15808: You think I’m in any danger?
15809: Force of arms is it, you claim!                  9805
15810: Hold me fast, you foolish ranger,
15811: And I’ll scotch your little game.
15812: 
15813: (She turns to flame and flashes into the air.)
15814: 
15815: Follow me through flowing air,
15816: Follow me through caverns bare,
15817: Catch your fleeing prey again!                   9810
15818: 
15819: Euphorion (Shaking off the flames.)
15820: 
15821: Rocks all around me here,
15822: Deep in the forest view,
15823: Make me a prisoner,
15824: Though I’m still young and new.
15825: 
15826: Breezes are blowing fair,                        9815
15827: Waves now are breaking there:
15828: I hear both far away,
15829: I’d gladly be there today.
15830: 
15831: (He leaps further up the rocks.)
15832: 
15833: Helen, Faust and the Chorus
15834: 
15835: A chamois you’d imitate?
15836: We’re fearful of your fate.                      9820
15837: Euphorion
15838: 
15839: Ever higher I must climb.
15840: Ever further I must see.
15841: 
15842: Now I know where I stand!
15843: Amidst this semi-island,
15844: Amidst Pelop’s country,          9825
15845: Earth – kindred to the sea.
15846: 
15847: Chorus
15848: 
15849: Why not live here, in peace,
15850: Among hills and groves?
15851: Vines then for you we’ll seek,   9830
15852: Vines in their rows.
15853: 
15854: Vines on high ridges stand,
15855: Figs, there, and apples gold,
15856: Stay in this lovely land
15857: Stay, and grow old!
15858: 
15859: Euphorion
15860: 
15861: Do you dream of peaceful days?   9835
15862: Dream, then as dreamers may.
15863: War is the watchword though.
15864: Victory! It rings out so.
15865: 
15866: Chorus
15867: 
15868: He who in time of peace
15869: Wishes for war, soon             9840
15870: Witness’s the decease,
15871: Of hope, and fortune.
15872: 
15873: Euphorion
15874: 
15875: Those who made this land,
15876: With danger on every hand,
15877: Free, and courageously,                9845
15878: Gave their blood lavishly:
15879: 
15880: Bring holy meaning
15881: To that sacrifice –
15882: See us still conquering
15883: All whom we fight!                     9850
15884: 
15885: Chorus
15886: 
15887: Look up there, how high he climbs!
15888: Yet he seems to us no smaller:
15889: In his armour, as in triumph,
15890: How he gleams in steel and silver.
15891: 
15892: Euphorion
15893: 
15894: Each one’s no longer conscious         9855
15895: Of the high wall, or the rest:
15896: Since the one enduring fortress,
15897: Is the soldier’s iron breast.
15898: 
15899: If you’d live unconquered,
15900: Quickly arm, and fight the real foe:   9860
15901: Every wife an Amazon bred,
15902: And every child a hero.
15903: 
15904: Chorus
15905: 
15906: Sacred Poetry
15907: Climbing, and heavenly!
15908: Shines there, the fairest star,        9865
15909: Far there, and still so far!
15910: And yet it reaches here,
15911: Always, and still we hear,
15912: Joy, where we are.
15913: Euphorion
15914: 
15915: No, not as a child do I appear,         9870
15916: This youth comes armed, you see:
15917: In spirit he’s already a peer,
15918: Of the strong, the bold, and free.
15919: Now I go!
15920: Now, and lo,                            9875
15921: The path to glory shines for me.
15922: 
15923: Helen and Faust
15924: 
15925: You’ve scarcely been called to being,
15926: Scarcely come to daylight’s gleam,
15927: And from the heights you’re yearning,
15928: For the place of pain, it seems.        9880
15929: Are we two
15930: Naught to you?
15931: Is the sweetest bond a dream?
15932: 
15933: Euphorion
15934: 
15935: Don’t you hear the thundering wave?
15936: Through vale on vale the echoes call,   9885
15937: Host on host, in sand and spray,
15938: Shock on shock, in anguished fall.
15939: Understand
15940: The command
15941: Is death, now and for all.              9890
15942: 
15943: Helen, Faust and the Chorus
15944: 
15945: What horror! What disaster!
15946: Is then death ordained for you?
15947: Euphorion
15948: 
15949: Should I watch it from afar?
15950: No! I’ll share their trouble too.
15951: 
15952: Helen, Faust and the Chorus
15953: 
15954: Exuberance, danger,                                                    9895
15955: Deadliest fate!
15956: 
15957: Euphorion
15958: 
15959: Yes! – I am winged here,
15960: I will not wait!
15961: Onward! I must! I must!
15962: Let me but fly!                                                        9900
15963: 
15964: (He hurls himself into the air: his clothes bear him a moment, his head is
15965: illuminated and a streak of light follows.)
15966: 
15967: Chorus
15968: 
15969: Icarus! Icarus!
15970: No more! We sigh.
15971: 
15972: (A beautiful youth falls at the parents’ feet. We imagine we see a well-known
15973: form in the dead body, but the physical part vanishes at once, while an
15974: aureole rises like a comet to heaven. The clothes, cloak and lyre remain on
15975: the ground.)
15976: 
15977: Helen and Faust
15978: 
15979: At once, joy is followed,
15980: By bitterest pain.
15981: 
15982: Euphorion (From the depths.)
15983: 
15984: Mother, don’t leave me alone,                                          9905
15985: In the shadows’ domain!
15986: (Pause)
15987: 
15988: Chorus (Dirge.)
15989: 
15990: Not alone! – No matter where you are,
15991: For we believe in following you:
15992: Oh! Though from the day you part,
15993: Not one heart will part from you.         9910
15994: We scarcely wish to mourn you, even,
15995: We sing in envy of your fate:
15996: To you the clearest light of heaven,
15997: Gave song and courage, true and great.
15998: 
15999: Ah! You were born for earthly fate,       9915
16000: High descent and supreme power:
16001: Youth, sadly, while you went astray,
16002: Was torn from you in its first hour!
16003: You saw the world, with clearer vision,
16004: You understood the yearning heart,        9920
16005: The glow of lovely woman’s passion,
16006: And all singing’s rarest art.
16007: 
16008: Yet, irresistibly, you ran free,
16009: In nets of indiscipline: you
16010: Divorced yourself violently,              9925
16011: From custom, and from rule:
16012: Until at last, through thinking deeper,
16013: You gave courage greater weight,
16014: And wished to win to splendour,
16015: But that could not be your fate.          9930
16016: 
16017: Whose then? – The gloomy question,
16018: That destiny itself conceals,
16019: While in days unblessed by fortune,
16020: Our people’s silent blood congeals.
16021: But new songs will refresh them,          9935
16022: No longer bow them to the floor,
16023: The earth shall see them once again,
16024: As it saw them once before.
16025: (A complete Pause. The music ends.)
16026: 
16027: Helen (To Faust.)
16028: 
16029: Alas, the ancient word proves true for me, as well:
16030: That joy and beauty never lastingly unite.                             9940
16031: The thread of life, as the thread of love, is torn:
16032: Painfully, lamenting both, I must say: farewell,
16033: And enter your embrace, once, and then no more.
16034: Persephone, receive me, and this child of ours!
16035: 
16036: (She embraces Faust: her body vanishes, her dress and veil remain in his
16037: hands.)
16038: 
16039: Phorkyas (To Faust.)
16040: 
16041: Hold tight to what alone remains to you.                               9945
16042: Don’t let the garment go. Already, daemons
16043: Pull at its hem, and wish to drag it down
16044: Into the Underworld. Hold tight to it, now!
16045: It no longer veils the divinity you’ve lost,
16046: But it is divine. Employ then the priceless,                           9950
16047: Noble gift for yourself, and soar on high:
16048: It will carry you quickly from the lowest
16049: To the highest ether, while you can endure.
16050: We’ll meet once more, far away from here.
16051: 
16052: (Helen’s garments dissolve in mist, surround Faust, life him into the air, and
16053: drift away with him.)
16054: 
16055: (Phorkyas takes Euphorion’s tunic, cloak and lyre from the ground, steps
16056: forward to the proscenium, holds them aloft and speaks.)
16057: 
16058: As always, I’ve discovered something good!                             9955
16059: The flame itself has gone, that’s understood,
16060: Yet, for the world, I can’t be truly sad.
16061: Here’s enough to fuel the poets’ regiment,
16062: Stir their guild to envy, make them mad,
16063: And if I still can’t lend them any talent,                             9960
16064: At least I’ll have a costume for the lad.
16065: (She seats herself on a low column in the proscenium.)
16066: 
16067: Panthalis
16068: 
16069: Quick now, girls! We’re all free of the magic now,
16070: That old Thessalian woman’s enthralling spell,
16071: That jangling dizziness of confusing sound,
16072: Troubling the ear, and more the inner sense.             9965
16073: Down to Hades! Since with solemn step the Queen
16074: Descended swiftly. Let her faithful servants’
16075: Footsteps follow her downward path without delay.
16076: We’ll find her beside the Unfathomable Throne.
16077: 
16078: Chorus
16079: 
16080: Of course, queens are happy anywhere:                    9970
16081: Even in Hades they’re on top,
16082: Associating proudly with their peers,
16083: Persephone’s intimate company.
16084: But for us, then, in the background,
16085: Of the asphodel-meadowed depths,                         9975
16086: With their long rows of poplars,
16087: Their fruitless crowds of willows,
16088: What fun is there for us,
16089: Piping like bats at twilight,
16090: In cheerless, ghostly whispers?                          9980
16091: 
16092: Panthalis
16093: 
16094: Who wins no name, and wills no noble work,
16095: Belongs to the elements: so away with you!
16096: My own intense desire’s to be with my Queen,
16097: The individual’s loyalty and not just service.
16098: 
16099: (Exits.)
16100: 
16101: All
16102: 
16103: We’re returned to the light of day,                      9985
16104: No longer individual, it’s true,
16105: We feel it, and we know it,
16106: But we’ll never go back to Hades.
16107: Ever-living Nature,
16108: Makes the most valid claim                                             9990
16109: On our spirits, and we on her.
16110: 
16111: A Section of the Chorus
16112: 
16113: We in all the thousand branches’ whispering tremors, swaying murmurs,
16114: Sweetly rocked, will lightly draw the root-born founts of being upwards,
16115: To the twigs: and now with leaves, and now with the exuberant blossom,
16116: We’ll adorn their floating tresses, freely thriving in the breezes.     9995
16117: Straight away, now, as the fruit falls, happy crowds and flocks will gather,
16118: For the picking and the tasting, swift-arriving, busy-thronging:
16119: Bending down, now, all around us, as before the early gods.
16120: 
16121: A Second Section of the Chorus
16122: 
16123: We, against the rocky cliff face, by the smooth far-gleaming mirror,
16124: We will nestle, softly moving, in the gentle waves that flatter:       10000
16125: Listening, hearing every echo, birdsong, now, or reedy fluting,
16126: To the fearful voice of Pan, too, we’ll provide a ready answer:
16127: To the murmuring, send a murmur: to the thunder roll our thunder,
16128: In earth-shaking repetition, in threefold, or tenfold echo.
16129: 
16130: A Third Section of the Chorus
16131: 
16132: Sisters! We, of nimbler senses, hurry onwards with the waters:         10005
16133: For the richly covered, far-off, mountain ranges each entice us.
16134: Ever deeper, ever downward, in meandering curves we’ll water
16135: First the meadows, then the pastures, then the house and the garden,
16136: Where the slender tips of cypress, over banks and watery mirror,
16137: Over all the landscape, mark it, soaring skywards in the air.          10010
16138: 
16139: A Fourth Section of the Chorus
16140: 
16141: Wander where you please, you others: we will circle, we will rustle
16142: Round the densely planted hillside, where the vine stock’s growing green:
16143: There, each day, we’ll pay attention to the cultivator’s passion,
16144: Watch his diligence and care, there: watch for its uncertain outcome.
16145: How he hoes, how he digs there, how he heaps, and prunes, and ties, 10015
16146: Prays to all the gods above him, most of all prays to the sun god.
16147: The effeminate one, Bacchus, gives scant thought to faithful servants,
16148: Rests in arbours, lolls in caverns, flirting with the youngest Faun.
16149: Whatsoever he might need there, for his half-befuddled dreaming,
16150: Is left for him in wineskins, stored around in jars and vessels,        10020
16151: Right and left, in cool recesses, gathered through the endless ages.
16152: But when the gods, that’s Helios we mean before all others,
16153: Cooling, wetting, warming, heating, fill the vineyard’s horn of plenty,
16154: Where the silent grower laboured, suddenly it’s all enlivened,
16155: And in every leaf there’s rustling, rustling now from vine to vine.     10025
16156: Baskets creaking, buckets rattling, the tubs are carried groaning,
16157: All towards enormous vats there, to the lusty treaders’ dance:
16158: So, then, all the sacred bounty, of the pure bred juicy harvest,
16159: Fiercely trodden, spurting, foaming, mingled there, is crudely squashed.
16160: Now the cymbals’ brazen clamour’s ringing boldly in our ears,           10030
16161: As Dionysus from his Mysteries is unveiled, and is revealed:
16162: Here with his goat-foot Satyrs, whirling goat-foot Satyresses,
16163: And Silenus’s, unruly, long-eared ass, that brays amongst them.
16164: Nothing’s spared! The cloven feet now, trample on all decency:
16165: All the senses whirl, bewildered: hideously, ears are stunned, there. 10035
16166: Drunkards fumble for their wine-cups, head and bellies over-full,
16167: Here and there one has misgivings, but can only swell the riot,
16168: Since to hold the latest vintage, one must drain the oldest skin!
16169: 
16170: (The curtain falls. Phorkyas in the proscenium rises to full height, steps
16171: down from her tragic buskins, removes her mask and veil, and reveals
16172: herself as Mephistopheles, to point the last lines, by way of epilogue.)
16173: Part II Act IV Scene I: High Mountains
16174: 
16175: (Fierce, jagged rocky peaks. A cloud approaches, pauses and settles on a
16176: projecting ledge. It parts.)
16177: 
16178: Faust (Steps out.)
16179: 
16180: Gazing at those deep solitudes beneath my feet,
16181: I tread the mountain brink with deliberation,                        10040
16182: Leaving the cloud-vehicle that carried me,
16183: Softly, through bright day, over land and ocean.
16184: Slowly, not dispersing, now, it moves away.
16185: With a rolling movement, travelling eastward,
16186: And the eye follows in wondering admiration.                         10045
16187: Moving it divides, wave-like and changeable.
16188: Yet it shapes itself – My eyes can’t deceive me! –
16189: I see, reclining there, nobly, on sunlit pillows,
16190: A godlike female form, though it’s immense!
16191: An image of Juno, Leda, or Helen herself,                            10050
16192: Royally lovely, floating before my eyes.
16193: Ah! It’s already melting! Formlessly huge
16194: And towering it hangs in far icy eastern hills,
16195: Reflecting deep meaning from fine fleeting days.
16196: Yet a soft, delicate band of mist still clings                       10055
16197: To head and body, coolly caressing: and cheers me.
16198: Now it lifts lightly, soars higher and higher, there,
16199: Condensing. Does its enticing shape deceive me,
16200: Like some long-forgotten joy of earliest youth?
16201: The first riches of the heart’s depths flow again:                   10060
16202: I’d liken it to Aurora’s Love, light-winged:
16203: The first, swiftly felt, scarcely understood glance,
16204: That outshines every treasure when it’s held fast.
16205: The lovely form rises, now, like spiritual beauty,
16206: Not melting further, but lifting through the air,                    10065
16207: And carries, far-off, the best of what I am.
16208: 
16209: (A seven-league boot strides forward: another follows immediately.
16210: Mephistopheles steps out of them. The boots stride off quickly.)
16211: 
16212: Now that I call real onward striding!
16213: But tell me why you’re all alone,
16214: Climbing here among the horrors,
16215: In these horrendous gulfs of stone?                     10070
16216: I know them well, but with another face,
16217: In truth, the floor of Hell’s a similar place.
16218: 
16219: Faust
16220: 
16221: You’re never short of a foolish fantasy:
16222: You’ve dusted that one off again I see.
16223: 
16224: Mephistopheles (Seriously)
16225: 
16226: When the Lord God – and I know why as well –            10075
16227: Banished us from the air to deepest deeps,
16228: There, where round and round the glow of Hell,
16229: An eternal inward self-fuelled fire leaps,
16230: We found we were too brightly illuminated,
16231: Quite crowded, and uncomfortably situated.              10080
16232: All the devils fell to fits of coughing,
16233: The vents above them and beneath them puffing,
16234: Hell swollen with the sulphur’s stench and acid,
16235: Gave out its gas! The bubble was so massive,
16236: That soon the level surface of the earth,               10085
16237: Thick as it was, was forced to crack and burst.
16238: So we all gained another mountain from it,
16239: And what was ground, before, now is summit.
16240: From this they deduced the truest law,
16241: Turn lowest into highest, to be sure,                   10090
16242: Since we escaped from fiery prison there,
16243: To excessive power in the freer air:
16244: An open mystery, yet well concealed,
16245: And only lately publicly revealed. (Ephesians vi:xii)
16246: Faust
16247: 
16248: To me the mountain masses are nobly dumb,                 10095
16249: I don’t ask why they are, or where they’re from.
16250: When Nature in herself was grounded
16251: The ball of Earth she neatly rounded,
16252: Delighting in the mountains and the deep,
16253: Setting rock on rock, and peak on peak,                   10100
16254: Sloping the hills conveniently downward,
16255: Softening them to vales, gently bounded.
16256: They grow green, and joyfully she ranges,
16257: Without the need for any violent changes.
16258: 
16259: Mephistopheles
16260: 
16261: Yes, so you say! It’s clear as day to you:                10105
16262: But he knows otherwise who saw it too.
16263: I was there, while the void seethed below,
16264: Enduring all that swollen, fiery tide:
16265: When Moloch’s hammer forged cliffs, at a blow,
16266: And flung the ruined mountains, far and wide.             10110
16267: Those foreign boulders scattered through the land:
16268: Who knows what forces left them high and dry?
16269: Philosophers all have failed to understand,
16270: The rocks are there, and we must let them stand,
16271: We’ve damaged them, already, where they lie.              10115
16272: Only the true believers, the people, know,
16273: And nothing will shake their fond opinion,
16274: They, since their wisdom ripened long ago,
16275: Say it’s due to Satan’s wonderful dominion.
16276: The traveller climbs, with faith’s crutch, over ridges,   10120
16277: Across the Devil’s rocks, and Devil’s bridges.
16278: 
16279: Faust
16280: 
16281: Yet it’s still worth noting, since every feature,
16282: Reveals what it is the Devil sees in Nature.
16283: Mephistopheles
16284: 
16285: What’s that to me! Let Nature be what she is!
16286: The Devil was there: that’s what I’d have you notice!               10125
16287: We’re the folk, you see, who achieve great things:
16288: The signs are tumult, force, and what nonsense brings! –
16289: But shall I make myself understood at last: it’s best:
16290: Did nothing at all of ours please you in the slightest?
16291: You’ve looked down, from immeasurable heights,                      10130
16292: On the riches of the world, and its splendid sights. (Matthew iv)
16293: Yet, hard as you may be to fire,
16294: Didn’t you feel some deep desire?
16295: 
16296: Faust
16297: 
16298: I did! I saw a mighty plan.
16299: Guess!
16300: 
16301: Mephistopheles
16302: 
16303:             Oh, that’s easily done.                                 10135
16304: I’d find myself some capital city,
16305: It’s core the citizens’ greedy plenty,
16306: Crooked alleys and pointed gables,
16307: Cabbage, turnips, onions, market tables:
16308: Butcher’s stalls where flies all cluster:                           10140
16309: Round the fattened joints, pass muster:
16310: Wherever you move, there you’ll find
16311: Stench and activity, intertwined.
16312: Then wide streets, and wider squares,
16313: Measured, elegant thoroughfares:                                    10145
16314: And, at their end, no gates to bar you:
16315: Just boundless far-flung suburbs too.
16316: There I love to see all the carriages go by,
16317: The noisy rushing about from side to side,
16318: The endless running to and fro,                                     10150
16319: Of scattered ants in ceaseless flow.
16320: And when I walk, and when I ride,
16321: I’d be the central point implied,
16322: A hundred thousand honouring me.
16323: Faust
16324: 
16325: That could never content me though.               10155
16326: A swelling crowd is fine to see,
16327: All well-fed in their way, agreed,
16328: Well-bred, well-taught, all the three –
16329: Yet you’ve only made more rebels grow.
16330: 
16331: Mephistopheles
16332: 
16333: For myself, I’d deliberately create               10160
16334: A pleasure house in a pleasant place.
16335: Woods, hills, fields, meadows, open ground,
16336: With splendid gardens all around.
16337: Between green walls of velvet leaves,
16338: Straight walks, where artful shadows please,      10165
16339: Waterfalls, spanning the rocks, in pairs,
16340: And all those kinds of water-jet affairs:
16341: Rising nobly, while all round the dish,
16342: A thousand little fountains hiss and piss.
16343: Then I’d have a hut, snug and convenient,         10170
16344: Where beautiful women might be content:
16345: And pass the boundless time away
16346: In the sweetest solitude, and play.
16347: Women, I say: since, one and all,
16348: I think of their loveliness in the plural.        10175
16349: 
16350: Faust
16351: 
16352: Sardanapalus! Modern and rural!
16353: 
16354: Mephistopheles
16355: 
16356: Then might one ask to know your yearning?
16357: It’s something daring: I’ve no doubt.
16358: Since the moon was near you in your journeying,
16359: Might it be moon-madness you’re about?            10180
16360: Faust
16361: 
16362: Not at all! This earthly round
16363: Grants space for some mighty thing.
16364: We’ll attempt what’s astonishing,
16365: New strength for daring work I’ve found.
16366: 
16367: Mephistopheles
16368: 
16369: And shall you earn more glory by it too?           10185
16370: One sees the heroines have been with you.
16371: 
16372: Faust
16373: 
16374: I’ll win power, and property!
16375: The deed is all, and not the glory.
16376: 
16377: Mephistopheles
16378: 
16379: Yet future poets’ verse will stress
16380: The splendour of your bright success,              10190
16381: And inspire fools to foolishness.
16382: 
16383: Faust
16384: 
16385: All that’s far from you, indeed.
16386: What do you know of what Men need?
16387: Your contrary being, bitter, dire,
16388: What does it know of Man’s desire?                 10195
16389: 
16390: Mephistopheles
16391: 
16392: Let it all be as you wish it then!
16393: Trust fancy’s flight to me again.
16394: 
16395: Faust
16396: 
16397: My eyes were drawn towards the deepest ocean:
16398: It swelled, and heaped itself, upon itself,
16399: Then ebbed, and shook its waves again in motion,   10200
16400: Storming towards the wide shore’s level shelf.
16401: And that annoyed me: as the exuberance
16402: Of a free spirit, that values all its rights,
16403: Will transmit uneasy feelings to the dance
16404: Of the passionate blood that it excites.             10205
16405: I thought it chance: I gazed more intensely:
16406: The waves paused, rolled away from me,
16407: Far from what they’d reached in their pride:
16408: Time passes, and then once more comes the tide.
16409: 
16410: Mephistopheles (To the audience.)
16411: 
16412: There’s nothing new in that to greet my ears,        10210
16413: I’ve known it for a hundred thousand years.
16414: 
16415: Faust (Continuing passionately.)
16416: 
16417: It sweeps along, to whatever thousand ends:
16418: Fruitless itself, it fruitlessly extends:
16419: It swells and rolls and breaks and overwhelms
16420: The empty stretches of its barren realms.            10215
16421: There wave rules power-inspired wave, again
16422: Draws back – and yet still there’s nothing gained.
16423: If anything makes me despair, of my intent,
16424: It’s the aimless force of that wild element!
16425: Then my spirit dared to soar high above:             10220
16426: Here I must fight, and this I must remove.
16427: And it’s possible! – However tides may flow,
16428: At last they nestle round the hills below:
16429: So they are tamed in their exuberance,
16430: A modest height tops their proud advance,            10225
16431: A modest depth draws them forcefully on.
16432: Quick, through my mind, leapt plan after plan:
16433: Let rich enjoyment be mine for evermore,
16434: To keep the noble ocean from the shore,
16435: To channel all the wide and watery waste,            10230
16436: And urge it backwards to its own deep place.
16437: Step by step I know how to design it:
16438: That’s my desire, so be brave and promote it!
16439: (On the right, from the distance, behind the audience, the sound of drums
16440: and military music.)
16441: 
16442: Mephistopheles
16443: 
16444: That’s trivial! Can you hear the distant drums?
16445: 
16446: Faust
16447: 
16448: War again! The wise man hates it when it comes.                       10235
16449: 
16450: Mephistopheles
16451: 
16452: War or peace, it’s wise to seize the chance,
16453: And gain advantage from the circumstance.
16454: One waits, one notes each favourable moment.
16455: Opportunity’s about, so Faust, be ardent!
16456: 
16457: Faust
16458: 
16459: Spare me all your riddles, if you please!                             10240
16460: Once and for all, say, what am I to seize?
16461: 
16462: Mephistopheles
16463: 
16464: Nothing was hidden from me on my journey:
16465: The noble Emperor’s consumed by worry.
16466: You know him. While we both supplied him,
16467: Those illusory riches in his hand, beside him,                        10245
16468: The whole world then was open to him.
16469: Young, the throne was granted to him,
16470: And it pleased him to assume, wrongly,
16471: That he could easily combine the two,
16472: Enjoy the essential and the lovely too:                               10250
16473: Both government and pleasure, jointly.
16474: 
16475: Faust
16476: 
16477: A fatal error! He who wishes to command
16478: Must make command his joy, and though
16479: His mind is full of all the noblest plans,
16480: What he intends, must let no other know.             10255
16481: What he whispers then in some faithful ear,
16482: Is done, and the world will be amazed to hear.
16483: So he’ll remain supreme, above them all,
16484: And noblest: pleasure comes before a fall.
16485: 
16486: Mephistopheles
16487: 
16488: That’s not the man! He enjoyed himself, and how!     10260
16489: Meanwhile anarchy brought the empire down,
16490: While great fought little, and orders crossed,
16491: And brothers fought with brothers, and were lost,
16492: Castle with castle, city against city,
16493: The guilds at war with the nobility:                 10265
16494: The bishops with their congregation:
16495: No friends, and only a hostile nation.
16496: In churches death and slaughter: through the gate
16497: Every merchant and trader swift to his fate.
16498: Now, everywhere, man’s audacity shows:               10270
16499: The word is ‘defend your life’. And so it goes.
16500: 
16501: Faust
16502: 
16503: So it goes – it stumbles, falls, and stands again,
16504: Then tumbles headlong, and lies there in pain.
16505: 
16506: Mephistopheles
16507: 
16508: None dared to criticise the situation,
16509: Each could, and would improve his station.           10275
16510: Even the smallest wished to be great enough.
16511: But for the best it proved a step too much.
16512: The capable declared, with energy:
16513: ‘He who brings peace can have the mastery.
16514: The Emperor can’t, and will not – let us choose      10280
16515: A new Emperor, who’ll inspire the realm anew.
16516: While each man achieves security,
16517: In a world that’s re-created freshly,
16518: Let peace and justice there be wedded, too.’
16519: Faust
16520: 
16521: That smacks of priesthood.                                             10285
16522: 
16523: Mephistopheles
16524:                     The priests were there, yes,
16525: Defending their well-fed stomachs with the rest,
16526: And they were more involved than all the others.
16527: The rebels swarmed: and were blessed as brothers:
16528: Then the Emperor, whom we had made happy,
16529: Advanced, for his last battle, that’s as maybe.                        10290
16530: 
16531: Faust
16532: 
16533: I’m sorry for him: He was so frank and open.
16534: 
16535: Mephistopheles
16536: 
16537: We’ll watch! While there’s life there’s hope again.
16538: Let’s set him free, from this narrow valley!
16539: He’s a thousand times saved, if they would rally.
16540: Who knows how the dice might fall, if so:                              10295
16541: Good luck, and he’ll have treasures to bestow.
16542: 
16543: (They cross over the middle range of hills, and view the army in the valley.
16544: Drums and military music sound from below.)
16545: 
16546: The position they’ve taken, there, looks fine:
16547: We’ll join them: victory – in the nick of time.
16548: 
16549: Faust
16550: 
16551: And what should I expect to see?
16552: A hollow show! Blind magic! Trickery!                                  10300
16553: Mephistopheles
16554: 
16555: Strategy, and how to win a battle!
16556: Think hard, and be on your mettle,
16557: Keep dreaming of your mighty aim.
16558: If we return the Emperor his land,
16559: You can kneel, and make a claim,             10305
16560: In payment, for the boundless strand.
16561: 
16562: Faust
16563: 
16564: You’ve managed all the other things,
16565: So win the battle, and what it brings!
16566: 
16567: Mephistopheles
16568: 
16569: No, you’ll win it! There, beneath,
16570: You’ll be their commander-in-chief.          10310
16571: 
16572: Faust
16573: 
16574: That’s a somewhat glorified position:
16575: Knowing nothing, to command the mission!
16576: 
16577: Mephistopheles
16578: 
16579: Leave it to the General Staff to care,
16580: And see a Field-Marshall newborn there.
16581: I know all about Un-Councils of War          10315
16582: Form your War Council, quickly, therefore,
16583: From ancient hills’ ancient human power:
16584: Bless those who can pile peaks in a tower.
16585: 
16586: Faust
16587: 
16588: What do I see, what warriors approach?
16589: Have you truly roused the mountain folk?     10320
16590: Mephistopheles
16591: 
16592: No! But like Shakespeare’s Peter Quince,
16593: I’ve picked the very best of what there is.
16594: 
16595: (The Three Mighty Warriors appear.)
16596: 
16597: Here are my lads arriving now!
16598: You see they’re all of different ages,
16599: And clothes and armour too: allow                     10325
16600: That you’ll be fine when battle rages.
16601: 
16602: (To the audience.)
16603: 
16604: Every child today loves to see
16605: Knights in armour take the floor:
16606: Allegorical though they may be,
16607: They’ll delight them all the more.                    10330
16608: 
16609: Bullyboy (Young, lightly armed, plainly clothed.)
16610: 
16611: If someone meets me face to face,
16612: I’ll shake a fist right there in his ugly mug,
16613: And when the yellow-belly runs away,
16614: I’ll grasp his hair, and give a nasty tug.
16615: 
16616: Grab-quick (Mature, well-armed, richly dressed.)
16617: 
16618: Such idle brawling’s foolishness,                     10335
16619: That’s how to ruin the day:
16620: Don’t be slow first to possess,
16621: Then afterwards you’ll get your way.
16622: 
16623: Hold-tight (Older, heavily armed, without a cloak.)
16624: 
16625: But that’s the path where little’s won!
16626: Great possession’s quickly gone,                      10340
16627: Vanishing in the stream of life.
16628: It’s fine to take, but best to hold:
16629: Let grey hairs command the bold,
16630: And you’ll lose nothing in the strife.
16631: Part II Act IV Scene II: On the Headland
16632: 
16633: (Drums and military music from below. The Emperor’s tent is pitched.)
16634: 
16635: (The Emperor, Commander-in-Chief, Guardsmen.)
16636: 
16637: The Commander-in-Chief
16638: 
16639: It still seems the most likely strategy,                            10345
16640: To have made our whole army wait,
16641: Here below, in this convenient valley:
16642: I hope the choice is truly fortunate.
16643: 
16644: The Emperor
16645: 
16646: Whatever will happen now, we’ll soon see:
16647: But I don’t like this half-retreat, it’s weak.                      10350
16648: 
16649: The Commander-in-Chief
16650: 
16651: Look here, my Prince, on our right flank!
16652: This terrain is one that Generals like to thank:
16653: The hills aren’t steep, but there’s no ready access,
16654: So it protects us, while denying them success:
16655: We’re half-concealed, on undulating ground:                         10355
16656: Their cavalry won’t dare to circle round.
16657: 
16658: The Emperor
16659: 
16660: There’s nothing left for me to do, but praise:
16661: Here strength and bravery may have their day.
16662: 
16663: The Commander-in-Chief
16664: 
16665: There, in the centre of the level space,
16666: See the phalanx, eagerly in place.                                  10360
16667: The lances shine and glitter in the air,
16668: Through the sunlit mist of morning, there.
16669: And all the mighty square is swaying darkly!
16670: Thousands inspired to fierce activity.
16671: There you can see our power en masse,                     10365
16672: I trust it to split the enemy in half.
16673: 
16674: The Emperor
16675: 
16676: This is the first time I’ve ever gazed on such a sight.
16677: Forces like these are worth double when they fight.
16678: 
16679: The Commander-in-Chief
16680: 
16681: I’ve nothing to report about our left,
16682: Valiant heroes hold the rocky cleft,                      10370
16683: Weapons gleam across the rocky dale,
16684: A vital pass protects the narrow vale.
16685: Here the enemy power, I think, will shatter,
16686: Taken unawares in this bloody matter.
16687: 
16688: The Emperor
16689: 
16690: There they advance, my faithless kith and kin,            10375
16691: Even as they call me brother, uncle, cousin,
16692: Ever more widely, allowing men’s respect
16693: For throne and sceptre to fall into neglect:
16694: Ruining the empire with their fighting,
16695: And now, against me, rebelliously uniting.                10380
16696: The mob is swayed, uncertain in its mind,
16697: Then, wherever the stream flows, flows behind.
16698: 
16699: The Commander-in-Chief
16700: 
16701: A faithful soldier hastens towards us, look,
16702: One sent for news, perhaps he’s had some luck!
16703: 
16704: First Scout
16705: 
16706: Luckily we met success,                                   10385
16707: Brave and cunning in our skill,
16708: Probing, out to east and west,
16709: Yet bring you bad news, still.
16710: Many swear their loyalty,
16711: Many a faithful company:                                   10390
16712: Yet all idly apologetic:
16713: Quailing inwardly, apathetic.
16714: 
16715: The Emperor
16716: 
16717: From selfishness they learn self-preservation,
16718: Not honour, affection, gratitude, dedication.
16719: No one thinks that when time brings the reckoning,         10395
16720: The neighbour’s house ignites theirs while it’s burning.
16721: 
16722: The Commander-in-Chief
16723: 
16724: The second scout’s approaching, slowly,
16725: On stumbling legs: a man full weary.
16726: 
16727: Second Scout
16728: 
16729: At first we easily detected
16730: The nature of their wild plan:                             10400
16731: Then, suddenly, and unexpected,
16732: A second Emperor was at hand.
16733: And in a calm, and orderly manner
16734: Withdrew the army from the deep:
16735: Unfurling his deceitful banner:                            10405
16736: They all followed him, like sheep!
16737: 
16738: The Emperor
16739: 
16740: A second Emperor’s fortunate for me:
16741: Since I’m the Emperor, plain as plain can be.
16742: Now as a soldier I’ll dress myself, again,
16743: In armour, dedicated to this higher aim.                   10410
16744: My entertainments, fine as they all were,
16745: Lacking in nothing, never brought me danger.
16746: While you suggested something innocent,
16747: My heart longed to fight the tournament:
16748: And had you not dissuaded me from war,                     10415
16749: I’d have shone in glorious deeds before.
16750: But when I was mirrored in that realm of fire,
16751: I felt my heart was mine, and made entire:
16752: The fierce element entered in my fate,
16753: Only a dream, and yet the dream was great.                            10420
16754: I’ve thought confusedly of fame and glory:
16755: Yet all was my own neglect, an evil story.
16756: 
16757: (The heralds are sent to challenge the rival Emperor to single combat.)
16758: 
16759: (Faust enters, in armour, with half-closed visor. The Three Mighty Warriors
16760: appear armed and dressed as previously described.)
16761: 
16762: Faust
16763: 
16764: We’re here, and hope our presence is accepted:
16765: Though needless, caution’s often well respected.
16766: You know how hill-folk consider and explore:                          10425
16767: They study nature and the mountains’ lore.
16768: The spirits drawn from out the level valley,
16769: Are happier than ever in the wide hill-country.
16770: They still work the labyrinthine masses,
16771: Among metallic fumes of noble gases.                                  10430
16772: Intent on separating, proving, blending,
16773: Their only aim some innovative finding.
16774: With gentle touch and spiritual power,
16775: They build transparent forms, by the hour:
16776: Then in eternal silence, in the crystal,                              10435
16777: They watch the destiny of all things mortal.
16778: 
16779: The Emperor
16780: 
16781: I’ve heard it said: and I believe it’s true:
16782: But, gallant soldier, what’s all that to you?
16783: 
16784: Faust
16785: 
16786: Your true and honourable servant there,
16787: Is that Sabine, the Norcian Necromancer.                              10440
16788: What fearful fate once hung above his head!
16789: Crackling wood, the stinging fire ahead:
16790: Dry timber packed already round his feet,
16791: With rolls of pitch and brimstone all complete:
16792: No warrior, god, or devil to the rescue,               10445
16793: The Emperor saved his life: and that was you,
16794: In Rome: he was obliged, and none the less
16795: Anxiously, he contemplates your progress.
16796: Wholly forgotten: every hour, just for you,
16797: He studies the stars and the abyss too.                10450
16798: He sent us on, by the swiftest path,
16799: To help you. Great is the mountain craft:
16800: There Nature works omnipotent, and free,
16801: Though foolish clerics call it wizardry.
16802: 
16803: The Emperor
16804: 
16805: On joyful days, when we greet our guests,              10455
16806: Who gather pleasantly, with happy jests,
16807: It gives us pleasure, when they pull and push,
16808: And fill the halls and chambers with their crush.
16809: Yet the brave man meets with noblest welcome,
16810: When in fierce support he deigns to come,              10460
16811: At the dawning of some perilous day,
16812: When fate’s balance holds us in its sway.
16813: Yet while some time this moment can afford,
16814: Hold back your strong hand from the eager sword,
16815: Honour the instant, when thousands march,              10465
16816: For or against me, taking up the torch.
16817: Self’s the Man! Who claims the crown and throne,
16818: Must be worthy of the honour, on his own.
16819: May the phantom now that stands against me,
16820: Who calls himself the Emperor of my country,           10470
16821: The army’s leader, and the lords’ crowned head,
16822: Be hurled by my own fist among the dead.
16823: 
16824: Faust
16825: 
16826: Whatever the need to finish what you’ve started,
16827: It would go ill if you and your head were parted.
16828: Isn’t your helmet decked with plume and crest?         10475
16829: It shields the head that fills our hearts with zest.
16830: Without a head what can the members do?
16831: If it should sleep, they sink in silence too:
16832: If it’s injured, they’re all hurt alike,
16833: And if it’s healed they quickly stir to life.    10480
16834: Swiftly the arm will assert its right:
16835: And shield the head then from the fight:
16836: The sword at once perceives its duty,
16837: Strikes again, and parries strongly:
16838: The brave foot, owning its luck again,           10485
16839: Plants itself on the necks of the slain.
16840: 
16841: The Emperor
16842: 
16843: Such is my wrath, that’s how I’d use the fool,
16844: And set his head in front of me, for a stool.
16845: 
16846: Heralds (Returning.)
16847: 
16848: Our advances they reject,
16849: With little honour, or respect.                  10490
16850: Our strong, and noble ultimatum,
16851: They treated as an empty statement:
16852: ‘Your Emperor is wholly lost,
16853: An echo of some ancient rhyme:
16854: When we think about the past,                    10495
16855: His tale will be: Once upon a time.’
16856: 
16857: Faust
16858: 
16859: It’s come to pass as the best of men demand,
16860: Those firm and true, at your right hand:
16861: There is the foe: your men stand by us:
16862: Order the advance, the time’s propitious.        10500
16863: 
16864: The Emperor
16865: 
16866: I hereby relinquish the command.
16867: 
16868: (To the Commander-In-Chief)
16869: Prince, I entrust the duty to your hand.
16870: 
16871: The Commander-in-Chief
16872: 
16873: Then let the right wing start its assault!
16874: The enemy left’s ascending, even now,
16875: And in a moment will be forced to halt.           10505
16876: To our young faithfuls they will have to bow.
16877: 
16878: Faust
16879: 
16880: Let this brave hero, straight away,
16881: Join your ranks, without delay,
16882: So that in your ranks he might,
16883: Make a brave show in the fight.                   10510
16884: 
16885: (He points to the Mighty Warrior on the right.)
16886: 
16887: Bully-Boy (Coming forward.)
16888: 
16889: He who shows his face to me, won’t turn
16890: Before his front and back teeth shatter:
16891: He who shows his back to me will earn
16892: A blow to make his head much flatter.
16893: And if your soldiers then advance                 10515
16894: With sword and mace, together,
16895: Man after man, the foe will dance,
16896: And in their own blood quickly smother.
16897: 
16898: (He exits.)
16899: 
16900: The Commander-in-Chief
16901: 
16902: Let the central phalanx follow slowly,
16903: Engage the enemy with force and cunning:          10520
16904: There on the right they’re almost ready
16905: To surrender, you can see them running.
16906: Faust (Pointing to the central Warrior)
16907: 
16908: Let this man follow at your command!
16909: He’s quick, and grabs with either hand.
16910: 
16911: Grab-quick (Comes forward.)
16912: 
16913: The thirst for plunder now will greet              10525
16914: The Emperor’s troops’ advancing feet,
16915: And all will gather, with intent,
16916: At the rival Emperor’s tent.
16917: He won’t linger on his throne:
16918: I’ll lead the phalanx on my own.                   10530
16919: 
16920: Swift-plunder (A camp follower, fawning on him.)
16921: 
16922: Although he and I aren’t wed,
16923: He’s my sweetheart. Here instead
16924: Autumn ripens for the bold!
16925: Woman’s fierce when she takes hold,
16926: Merciless, in a plundering crowd,                  10535
16927: Forward to victory! All’s allowed.
16928: 
16929: (They exit together.)
16930: 
16931: The Commander-in-Chief
16932: 
16933: As I anticipated on our left flank,
16934: They hurl their right, in force, at last.
16935: We’ll resist their furious ranks,
16936: And keep them from the narrow pass.                10540
16937: 
16938: Faust (Beckoning to the Warrior on the left.)
16939: 
16940: Prince, take note of this man too:
16941: No shame if the strong are stronger than you.
16942: 
16943: Hold-tight (Coming forward.)
16944: 
16945: Let the flanks forget their fear!
16946: I seize the ground where I appear:
16947: In me are born the powers of old,                                    10545
16948: No lightning splits what I shall hold.
16949: 
16950: Mephistopheles (Descending from above.)
16951: 
16952: Now see how from the hinterland
16953: Of this rocky jagged land,
16954: An armed host bursts forth
16955: On narrow pathways from the north,                                   10550
16956: With sword and helmet, shield and spear,
16957: Forming a rampart in our rear:
16958: They wait for the signal to charge on.
16959: 
16960: (Aside, to the knowing ones.)
16961: 
16962: You mustn’t ask me where they’re from.
16963: I’ve gathered them from everywhere,                                  10555
16964: The armouries all around are bare:
16965: They stood on foot, and sat astride,
16966: Like lords of earth on every side:
16967: They were emperors, knights, and kings,
16968: Now they’re the empty shells of things:                              10560
16969: I’ve dressed so many spirits for the strife,
16970: It’s like the Middle Ages come to life.
16971: Whichever little devils are inside,
16972: They’ll have enough effect to turn the tide.
16973: 
16974: (Aloud.)
16975: 
16976: Listen how they show their anger,                                    10565
16977: Jostling, in metallic clangour!
16978: The ragged banners flutter free,
16979: That waited restless for the breeze.
16980: Think: here’s an ancient race that’s ready
16981: To mingle in our new dispute, and gladly.                            10570
16982: 
16983: (A tremendous peal of trumpets from above: a perceptible tremor in the
16984: hostile army.)
16985: Faust
16986: 
16987: The far horizon darkens swiftly,
16988: Yet, here and there, and meaningfully,
16989: There’s an incipient crimson glow,
16990: Already the battlefield gleams there,
16991: The rocks, the woods, the atmosphere,    10575
16992: The very heavens join the show.
16993: 
16994: Mephistopheles
16995: 
16996: The right flank holds in strength:
16997: There’s Bullyboy the nimble giant,
16998: Towering over all, defiant,
16999: And charging them at length.             10580
17000: 
17001: The Emperor
17002: 
17003: First I saw an arm uplifted,
17004: Then at least a dozen shifted:
17005: The thing’s unnatural.
17006: 
17007: Faust
17008: 
17009: Don’t you know the bands of mist
17010: That drift round the Sicilian cliffs?    10585
17011: There, in the daylight, clear,
17012: In mid-air, hovering about
17013: Mirrored in peculiar cloud,
17014: Marvellous images appear.
17015: Cities wander to and fro,                10590
17016: Gardens rise above, below,
17017: As form on form fills the air.
17018: 
17019: The Emperor
17020: 
17021: Yet it’s suspicious! All about
17022: The tips of spears are shining out:
17023: On our phalanx’ gleaming lances,         10595
17024: I see a crowd of flame-lets dances.
17025: It looks quite ghostly there, to me.
17026: 
17027: Faust
17028: 
17029: Forgive me, Lord, those are the traces
17030: Of natural spirits, vanished races,
17031: A glimmer of the Dioscuri,                           10600
17032: Sailors invoke in tempest’s fury:
17033: They show their last strength there.
17034: 
17035: The Emperor
17036: 
17037: But tell me: who then might command
17038: Nature’s assistance for our land,
17039: This gathering of the rare?                          10605
17040: 
17041: Mephistopheles
17042: 
17043: Who else than that noble Master,
17044: Who takes your destiny to heart?
17045: The thought of military disaster
17046: Moves him deeply, stirs his art.
17047: In gratitude, he wants to save you,                  10610
17048: Though he himself should suffer too.
17049: 
17050: The Emperor
17051: 
17052: They cheered me, when I was invested:
17053: So I was keen to see my power tested:
17054: I found it useful, without much thought, as ruler,
17055: To send that wise man where the air was cooler.      10615
17056: I robbed the clergy of a fond desire,
17057: And hardly won their favour from the fire.
17058: Now that so many years have gone
17059: Is this the reward of what I’d done?
17060: Faust
17061: 
17062: Good deeds from the heart reap riches:     10620
17063: Let your glance stray upwards now!
17064: I think he’ll send a sign, a show,
17065: Attend: straight away it’s as he wishes.
17066: 
17067: The Emperor
17068: 
17069: An eagle soars in the upper air,
17070: A Gryphon attacks him there.               10625
17071: 
17072: Faust
17073: 
17074: Attend: It’s an auspicious feature.
17075: The Gryphon’s a fabulous creature:
17076: How could he forget who’s regal,
17077: And tangle with a real eagle?
17078: 
17079: The Emperor
17080: 
17081: And now, they fly in wider gyres,          10630
17082: They wheel together: swiftly now
17083: Then dash against each other’s bow,
17084: So neck and chest are ripped entire.
17085: 
17086: Faust
17087: 
17088: Now note the miserable Gryphon,
17089: Ripped and rumpled, hurt quite badly,      10635
17090: Now, with his lion’s tail all torn,
17091: He falls, and vanishes in a tree.
17092: 
17093: The Emperor
17094: 
17095: As it’s prophesied, so let it be!
17096: This whole thing’s astounding me.
17097: Mephistopheles (Towards the right.)
17098: 
17099: Driven by blows, ten times repeated,      10640
17100: The enemy force has retreated,
17101: And in the uncertain fight
17102: Drifts away towards the right,
17103: So defusing all the force
17104: Of their army’s sinister course.          10645
17105: Our phalanx with its spears tightening
17106: Moves to the right, and like lightening
17107: Strikes them in the weakest place:
17108: Now like the storm-driven waves
17109: They roar, with opposing force,           10650
17110: Wildly on their dual course:
17111: Gloriously all sound dies away,
17112: And victory is ours, I’d say!
17113: 
17114: The Emperor (On the left, to Faust.)
17115: 
17116: See! Something looks suspicious,
17117: Our position’s inauspicious,              10655
17118: Not a stone’s hurled in the air,
17119: The cliffs below are taken there,
17120: Bare the narrows, to the pass.
17121: Now! The enemy en masse
17122: Are ever nearer to the sun,               10660
17123: Perhaps we’re already overrun:
17124: An end to this unholy strife!
17125: Your arts won’t save my life.
17126: 
17127: (Pause.)
17128: 
17129: Mephistopheles
17130: 
17131: See, my two ravens come winging,
17132: What news might they be bringing?         10665
17133: I fear we’re in trouble here.
17134: The Emperor
17135: 
17136: What do they mean these wretched birds?
17137: Their black wings turn hitherwards,
17138: Out of the heat of battle they steer.
17139: 
17140: Mephistopheles (To the ravens.)
17141: 
17142: Both of you sit by my ear,                10670
17143: None are lost if you are near,
17144: Your council’s always good to hear.
17145: 
17146: Faust (To the Emperor.)
17147: 
17148: You’ll know about homing pigeons
17149: Ones that return from distant regions,
17150: To their nest, and food, and young.       10675
17151: Here’s a slightly different kind:
17152: Pigeon post in peace is fine,
17153: Raven posts to war belong.
17154: 
17155: Mephistopheles
17156: 
17157: The birds announce a dreadful fate:
17158: Beware the enemy at the gate,             10680
17159: Near our heroes’ rocky wall!
17160: They’ve attained the narrow height,
17161: If they gain the pass, and fight,
17162: Our position’s critical.
17163: 
17164: The Emperor
17165: 
17166: So I’m betrayed at last!                  10685
17167: Into your net I’ll be cast:
17168: I shudder as it entangles me.
17169: Mephistopheles
17170: 
17171: Courage, now! Not yet, their victory.
17172: Patience and skill unties the knot!
17173: It’s often fiercest at the end.                         10690
17174: The pair of messengers, we’ve got:
17175: Command me, I’ll command them!
17176: 
17177: The Commander-In-Chief (Who has arrived, meanwhile.)
17178: 
17179: You’ve united with this pair,
17180: Tormenting me while I was there,
17181: No luck comes from wizardry.                            10695
17182: I can’t fathom now how to win
17183: Those should finish, that begin:
17184: Take this baton away from me.
17185: 
17186: The Emperor
17187: 
17188: Keep it for another day, one better
17189: And blessed with better fortune.                        10700
17190: I shudder at this messenger,
17191: And his company of ravens.
17192: 
17193: (To Mephistopheles.)
17194: 
17195: I’ll not grant the baton to you,
17196: You’re not the proper man:
17197: Give commands: free us too!                             10705
17198: Do whatever it is you can.
17199: 
17200: (He exits into his tent with the Commander-In-Chief.)
17201: 
17202: Mephistopheles
17203: 
17204: Let that blunt stick protect the man!
17205: It’s of small use in anyone’s hand:
17206: It has a cross, too, painted on.
17207: Faust
17208: 
17209: What can we do?
17210: 
17211: Mephistopheles
17212: 
17213:                           It’s already done!          10710
17214: Now dark Cousins, hurry from the scene,
17215: To the mountain lake! Greet the Undines,
17216: And beg from them their gleaming flood.
17217: Their female arts, those difficult of knowing,
17218: Can divorce appearances from being,                   10715
17219: And all still swear it’s being that they’re seeing.
17220: 
17221: (Pause)
17222: 
17223: Faust
17224: 
17225: With flattery our pair of ravens
17226: Have so charmed those water maidens
17227: That trickling flows at once begin.
17228: And many a bald, dry ridge of mountain                10720
17229: Becomes a swollen, rushing fountain:
17230: The enemy can no longer win.
17231: 
17232: Mephistopheles
17233: 
17234: It’s not a greeting to which they’re used.
17235: The bravest climbers appear confused.
17236: 
17237: Faust
17238: 
17239: Now, powerfully, streams pour on streams,             10725
17240: Sweeping from gorges with redoubled gleams,
17241: A river now throws up an arching veil:
17242: Pours over the rocky level in a tide,
17243: Runs foaming down, on every side,
17244: And, stepwise, hurls itself into the dale.            10730
17245: What use their fine, heroic resistance?
17246: The vast wave roars, and fills the distance.
17247: I shudder myself at this wild waterfall.
17248: 
17249: Mephistopheles
17250: 
17251: I can see nothing of these watery lies,
17252: They only serve for fooling human eyes,             10735
17253: I delight instead in wonders that befall.
17254: In companies, their men plunge down,
17255: The fools imagine that they’ll drown,
17256: While free to breathe, on solid ground,
17257: With swimming strokes, they run around.             10740
17258: It’s bewildering them all.
17259: 
17260: (The Ravens return.)
17261: 
17262: I’ll praise you to the noble Master: but see,
17263: If you’d like to display your own mastery,
17264: Hurry to the glowing smithy,
17265: Where the dwarf folk never weary,                   10745
17266: Hammering sparks from steel and stone.
17267: Ask for, once you’ve chattered first,
17268: A fire to shine: sparkle, and burst,
17269: The finest that man’s ever known.
17270: It’s true that far off lightning flashes,           10750
17271: And stars that fall in sudden dashes,
17272: Can happen any summer’s night:
17273: But lightning in the tangled bushes,
17274: And stars that fizzle in the rushes,
17275: They’re not such a common sight.                    10755
17276: Don’t trouble about my command,
17277: Ask first, then afterwards demand.
17278: 
17279: (The Ravens fly off. All takes place as ordered.)
17280: 
17281: Darkness cloaks the enemy!
17282: Their footsteps meet uncertainty!
17283: Everywhere are wandering flares,                    10760
17284: And those sudden blinding glares!
17285: It’s all beautiful indeed,
17286: Now some noise is what we need.
17287: Faust
17288: 
17289: The empty armour from each vaulted room,
17290: Feels itself stiffen in the airy gloom:                                 10765
17291: There it rattles, clatters all around,
17292: A marvellous, and deceptive sound.
17293: 
17294: Mephistopheles
17295: 
17296: That’s it! They no longer feel constrained:
17297: Already their blows fall unrestrained,
17298: As in the nobility of their former life.                                10770
17299: Breastplates and helmets gleam,
17300: As Guelph and Ghibelline,
17301: They quickly renew eternal strife.
17302: Locked in hereditary bile,
17303: They prove themselves, un-reconciled:                                   10775
17304: Far and wide the noise is rife.
17305: In the end, by all the Devils, yes!
17306: Partisan hatred’s still the best,
17307: Till final ruin ends the tale:
17308: Here rise the sounds of utter panic,                                    10780
17309: And others bitter and Satanic,
17310: Terrify, along the vale.
17311: 
17312: (Warlike tumult from the orchestra, finally changing to a lively martial air.)
17313: Part II Act IV Scene III: The Rival Emperor’s Tent
17314: 
17315: (A throne amongst rich trappings. Grab-quick and Swift-plunder.)
17316: 
17317: Swift-plunder
17318: 
17319: We’re the first ones here, I see!
17320: 
17321: Grab-quick
17322: 
17323: No Raven flies as fast as me.
17324: 
17325: Swift-plunder
17326: 
17327: O! Look at the treasure there on top!                              10785
17328: What will I grab? How shall I stop?
17329: 
17330: Grab-quick
17331: 
17332: The whole place is still full of loot,
17333: I don’t know where to start, in truth!
17334: 
17335: Swift-plunder
17336: 
17337: This fur-rug, this’ll go far,
17338: Often my bed’s far too hard.                                       10790
17339: 
17340: Grab-quick
17341: 
17342: Here’s a morning star in steel,
17343: I’ve always longed for one, I feel.
17344: 
17345: Swift-plunder
17346: 
17347: This red mantle, trimmed with gold,
17348: Is like the one my dream foretold.
17349: Grab-quick (Taking a weapon.)
17350: 
17351: With this the deed is swiftly done,     10795
17352: You strike him dead and then move on.
17353: You’ve already packed so much stuff,
17354: And yet you’ve nothing good enough.
17355: Leave your plunder in its place,
17356: And put a casket in the space!          10800
17357: The army’s pay is what they hold,
17358: In their fat bellies, purest gold.
17359: 
17360: Swift-plunder
17361: 
17362: What a murderous weight it is!
17363: I can’t lift: I can’t carry it.
17364: 
17365: Grab-quick
17366: 
17367: Bend down: quick! You’ll have to bow!   10805
17368: I’ll strap it to your back for now.
17369: 
17370: Swift-plunder
17371: 
17372: Oh! Ah! Now it’s in front, too!
17373: The weight’s broken my cross in two.
17374: 
17375: (The chest falls and bursts open.)
17376: 
17377: Grab-quick
17378: 
17379: There’s the red gold in a heap –
17380: Quickly now, take and keep!             10810
17381: 
17382: Swift-plunder (Crouching.)
17383: 
17384: Quickly then, just fill my lap!
17385: There’ll still be enough perhaps.
17386: Grab-quick
17387: 
17388: That’s enough! Now off you go!
17389: 
17390: (Swift-plunder rises.)
17391: 
17392: Oh! Your apron has a hole!
17393: Wherever you walk or stand,                 10815
17394: You’re sowing gold on every hand.
17395: 
17396: Guardsmen of the True Emperor
17397: 
17398: What are you doing here, at leisure,
17399: Rummaging in the Imperial treasure?
17400: 
17401: Grab-quick
17402: 
17403: We risked our bodies in the ranks,
17404: And take away our share of thanks.          10820
17405: That’s the rule, in enemy tents,
17406: And we’re soldiers too, my friends.
17407: 
17408: The Guardsmen
17409: 
17410: That won’t wash in our army:
17411: You can’t be soldier and thief equally:
17412: Whoever serves our Emperor,                 10825
17413: Is an honest soldier, and no more.
17414: 
17415: Grab-quick
17416: 
17417: That honesty, we know it, son,
17418: It’s called: a contribution.
17419: You’re all the same: it’s a crime,
17420: ‘Give!’ is the password every time,         10830
17421: 
17422: (To Swift-plunder.)
17423: 
17424: Take what you’ve got: and leave the rest,
17425: Here one’s hardly a welcome guest.
17426: (They both exit.)
17427: 
17428: A Guardsman
17429: 
17430: Tell me why you didn’t land
17431: That churl with a good right hand.
17432: 
17433: A Second Guardsman
17434: 
17435: I don’t know, my strength was gone,                              10835
17436: They were a pair of ghostly ones.
17437: 
17438: A Third Guardsman
17439: 
17440: There was something nasty in my eye,
17441: I couldn’t see: they flickered by.
17442: 
17443: A Fourth Guardsman
17444: 
17445: I don’t know what to say:
17446: It was sweltering hot today,                                     10840
17447: So sultry, so close as well,
17448: One man stood, another fell:
17449: You staggered around and struck, in one,
17450: At every blow you killed someone,
17451: There was a mist in front of your eyes,                          10845
17452: Then a buzz, and rustle, and hiss went by:
17453: So it went on, and here we are, now,
17454: I don’t know what happened, anyhow.
17455: 
17456: (The Emperor enters, accompanied by Four Princes. The Guardsmen exit.)
17457: 
17458: Now, let him do as he may! The battle here is done,
17459: The host is scattered in flight, across the field new won.       10850
17460: Here is the traitor’s treasure, and his empty throne,
17461: Where tapestries hang round, closed in a narrow zone.
17462: Protected by our guard of honour, we’ll wait
17463: Imperially, for the people’s delegate.
17464: Messengers of joy arrive from every side:                        10855
17465: The Empire’s calm, and we’re mutually reconciled.
17466: Though some wizardry was involved in our fight,
17467: In the end we fought with only our own true might.
17468: There were of course a few lucky accidents:
17469: Stones from the sky, a shower of blood on their tents,    10860
17470: Strange and mighty sounds from the rocky caves,
17471: That lifted our hearts, and terrified their braves.
17472: The conquered fell, beneath our relentless scorn,
17473: Praising the kind god, our ranks cheer once more.
17474: And all, without coercion, shout together as one:         10865
17475: ‘God be praised!’ from a million throats is wrung.
17476: Yet in highest praise I turn my own pious glance
17477: As I seldom do, towards my own circumstance.
17478: A young man may well squander his early days,
17479: But age teaches him all the error of his ways.            10870
17480: Therefore at once without delay I bind you to me,
17481: You noble four, to my House, Court and country.
17482: 
17483: (To the First.)
17484: 
17485: Prince, yours was the army’s ordering, wisely planned,
17486: Then, at the height of the battle, its bold command:
17487: Now act, in time of peace, as the hour requires you to,   10875
17488: I name you High-Marshall, and confer the sword on you.
17489: 
17490: The High-Marshall
17491: 
17492: Your loyal army, deployed, on my orders,
17493: Internally, will now defend your borders,
17494: Let us, too, prepare the table on feast days,
17495: In your spacious castle’s ancestral ways.                 10880
17496: Always to be your High Majesty’s defence,
17497: Standing beside you, or marching in advance.
17498: 
17499: The Emperor (To the Second.)
17500: 
17501: You, who show yourself as gracious as you’re brave,
17502: Be our High-Chamberlain: the office is grave.
17503: You become the overseer of all our attendants,            10885
17504: Great evil comes from strife among dependants:
17505: So let your example honourably recall
17506: How they may please their prince, the court and all.
17507: 
17508: The High-Chamberlain
17509: 
17510: Be gracious, that the Lords may further your great aim:
17511: Assist the best and cause no injury to the lame,          10890
17512: Be open without cunning: be calm without deceit!
17513: If you know me, Sire, my ambition is complete.
17514: But on the feast may I now deploy my imagination?
17515: When you’re at table, I shall bear the golden basin,
17516: I’ll hold your rings, that on those joyful days           10895
17517: Your hands may be refreshed, as I am by your gaze.
17518: 
17519: The Emperor
17520: 
17521: I feel too serious for ready celebration,
17522: But, be it so, as a joyful inauguration!
17523: 
17524: (To the Third.)
17525: 
17526: I make you High-Steward! Oversee the chase,
17527: The poultry yard, and such, around the place:             10900
17528: Give me the finest dishes, choice and rare,
17529: In their right month, and carefully prepared.
17530: 
17531: The High-Steward
17532: 
17533: Strict fast will be my pleasant punishment,
17534: Till I can serve the tastiest refreshment.
17535: Your kitchen staff will join with me to bring             10905
17536: The distant near, and make the year take wing.
17537: Yet early and rare won’t stimulate your fires,
17538: Simple and strong, is what your taste desires.
17539: 
17540: The Emperor (To the Fourth.)
17541: 
17542: Since planning feasts is unavoidable here,
17543: Young hero, I’ll give you my cup to bear.                 10910
17544: High-Cupbearer, take care those cellars of mine
17545: Are richly filled with casks of vintage wine.
17546: Be temperate yourself: don’t lose your reason
17547: In the wild delight of momentary temptation!
17548: 
17549: The High-Cupbearer
17550: 
17551: The young, if you trust in them, my Prince,             10915
17552: Grow to manhood, almost before you’d notice.
17553: I’ll take my place too at your noble feast:
17554: And load the imperial table with all that’s best,
17555: With every kind of vessel, in silver and gold,
17556: But the handsomest of all for you I’ll hold:            10920
17557: A clear Venetian glass, where joy is waiting,
17558: That strengthens the taste, without intoxicating.
17559: One often trusts too much in such a treasure:
17560: But your restraint, Lord, will protect your pleasure.
17561: 
17562: The Emperor
17563: 
17564: What I bestow on you at this grave moment,              10925
17565: You hear, in confidence, has my true intent.
17566: The Emperor’s word is great, his gift is sure,
17567: But to be enacted it needs his signature,
17568: His noble mark. Here’s the right man I see
17569: True to his time, to complete the formality.            10930
17570: 
17571: (The Archbishop and High-Chancellor enters.)
17572: 
17573: If the arch can trust the keystone’s part,
17574: Then it’s raised securely, with lasting art.
17575: You see four Princes here! And I’ve explained
17576: How my House and Court must be sustained.
17577: Now, what the empire holds within its bounds            10935
17578: Is placed, with weight and power, in your hands.
17579: You’ll outshine all others in your estates:
17580: So I’ve extended your walls and gates,
17581: With the lost possessions of our enemy.
17582: I award you fine lands, for your loyalty.               10940
17583: Together with the right, in due course,
17584: To buy, exchange, or add to them by force:
17585: Then, be it known, I grant you unhindered use –
17586: Of what belongs to you, the landlord’s dues.
17587: When you as judges speak your final thought,              10945
17588: No appeal shall be heard by a higher court.
17589: Then taxes, levies, rents, and tolls and fees,
17590: Are yours: of mines, mints, salt the royalties.
17591: And to display my gratitude completely,
17592: I’ve raised you all to highest majesty.                   10950
17593: 
17594: The Archbishop
17595: 
17596: On behalf of us all I give our deepest thanks to you!
17597: You make us strong and sure: increasing your power too.
17598: 
17599: The Emperor
17600: 
17601: To you five, still higher favours will I give.
17602: I live for my empire, and I still wish to live:
17603: Yet ancient, noble ties draw the careful thinker          10955
17604: From present things to those that follow after.
17605: I too, in time, must leave all I still hold dear,
17606: It’s your duty then to name a new ruler, here.
17607: At our holy altar, crown and raise him high:
17608: What war begins ends peacefully, by and by.               10960
17609: 
17610: The High-Chancellor
17611: 
17612: With pride at heart, yet humble in gesture, too,
17613: We, the Earth’s noblest princes bow to you.
17614: So long as blood fills our loyal veins, then still
17615: Are we the body that obeys your every will.
17616: 
17617: The Emperor
17618: 
17619: Now, to conclude, let everything we’ve enacted            10965
17620: Be set down for the future, as we’ve contracted.
17621: As Lords you hold your possessions, free in fact,
17622: With this condition, that they remain intact.
17623: And what you have from us, whatever else is won,
17624: Shall descend in due measure to the eldest son.           10970
17625: The High-Chancellor
17626: 
17627: I’ll entrust it to parchment straight away,
17628: This weightiest statute to bless us, and the state:
17629: The Chancery will provide fair copy, and reveal
17630: You as confirmed, my Lords, by sign and seal.
17631: 
17632: The Emperor
17633: 
17634: And so I dismiss you that you may deliberate           10975
17635: Together, concerning this great day for our state.
17636: 
17637: (The Secular Princes exit.)
17638: 
17639: The Archbishop
17640: 
17641: The Chancellor leaves, the Bishop remains here,
17642: With this grave warning to offer in your ear.
17643: His paternal heart, anxiously, fears for you.
17644: 
17645: The Emperor
17646: 
17647: Speak, in this happy hour, what care’s on view?        10980
17648: 
17649: The Archbishop
17650: 
17651: With what bitter pain I find that even at this hour,
17652: Your hallowed head still toys with Satan’s power!
17653: True, you’ve secured the throne now, yet it seems,
17654: Sadly, scorning God, and the Pope’s great schemes.
17655: When he learns of it, swift punishment he’ll bring,    10985
17656: And destroy your sinful realm with holy lightning.
17657: He’s not forgotten how, at that earlier time,
17658: Of coronation, you freed the wizard: in crime.
17659: With your diadem, you injured Christianity,
17660: Striking a cursed head with the first act of mercy.    10990
17661: Now beat your breast and from your guilty measure,
17662: Give back to the holy shrine a little treasure:
17663: You, taught humility, devote to pious use, and good,
17664: The spacious stretch of hills where your tent stood.
17665: Where evil spirits gathered for your protection,         10995
17666: And the Prince of Liars secured your attention:
17667: Grant mount and forest deep, as far as they extend,
17668: And heights, the green slopes adorn, without end.
17669: Clear lakes rich in fish, countless streams that flow,
17670: Winding swiftly, that rush to the valleys below:         11000
17671: Then the broad vale itself, meadow, lawn and hollow:
17672: Show your remorse: gain the mercy that must follow.
17673: 
17674: The Emperor
17675: 
17676: I’m deeply fearful of this, my heavy sin:
17677: Yourself, mark out the borders of the scheme.
17678: 
17679: The Archbishop
17680: 
17681: First then the place profaned by such sinfulness,        11005
17682: Dedicate that to the service of heavenliness.
17683: Thick walls rise quickly, at the mind’s desire,
17684: Already the sun’s dawn glance lights the choir,
17685: The growing building takes the cross’s structure,
17686: The nave long and high, a delight to each believer:      11010
17687: Already as they press eagerly through the doors,
17688: A first peal rings through hills, down valley floors,
17689: From the high tower, that’s striving towards heaven,
17690: The penitent comes, to whom new life is given.
17691: That day of consecration – may it be soon! –             11015
17692: When your presence grants the greatest boon.
17693: 
17694: The Emperor
17695: 
17696: Let the pious mind proclaim so great an action,
17697: In praising the Lord, I’ll achieve my expiation.
17698: Enough! I already feel my mind’s exaltation.
17699: 
17700: The Archbishop
17701: 
17702: As Chancellor I require a formal proclamation.           11020
17703: The Emperor
17704: 
17705: A formal document: lay that before me,
17706: I’ll be pleased to sign whatever the Church agrees.
17707: 
17708: The Archbishop (Has taken leave, but turns back at the door.)
17709: 
17710: At the same time devote the total income of the land,
17711: As it arises, tithes, taxes, levies, to the work on hand,
17712: Forever. It needs to be maintained, fairly,                     11025
17713: And its careful upkeep will cost us dearly.
17714: From all that plunder, grant us a measure of gold,
17715: To build it quickly there, in that desert fold.
17716: Moreover we’ll need, I can’t help mentioning,
17717: Timber from far off, lime, slate, and such things.              11030
17718: Exhorted from the pulpit, the folk will haul it,
17719: The Church will bless the man who learns to serve it.
17720: 
17721: (He exits.)
17722: 
17723: The Emperor
17724: 
17725: The sin with which my soul is heavy, is full sore:
17726: Wretched Sorcerers have wounded me, once more.
17727: 
17728: The Archbishop (Returning, yet again, and bowing deeply.)
17729: 
17730: Pardon, my Lord! The Imperial shore was given                   11035
17731: To that disreputable man, I’ll excommunicate him,
17732: Unless you in penitence grant the Church, there, too,
17733: Its tithes, and gifts, and taxes: the whole of its revenue.
17734: 
17735: The Emperor (In a bad humour.)
17736: 
17737: That land doesn’t exist, it lies there under the sea.
17738: 
17739: The Archbishop
17740: 
17741: Who’s patient, and is right, his time is yet to be.             11040
17742: For us, your word must wait on one man’s desire.
17743: (He exits.)
17744: 
17745: The Emperor (Alone.)
17746: 
17747: I might as well sign away the whole wide empire.
17748: Part II Act V Scene I: Open Country
17749: 
17750: The Wanderer
17751: 
17752: Yes! Here are the dusky lindens,
17753: Standing round, in mighty age.
17754: And here am I, returning to them,       11045
17755: After so long a pilgrimage!
17756: It still appears the same old place:
17757: Here’s the hut that sheltered me,
17758: When the storm-uplifted wave,
17759: Hurled me shore-wards from the sea!     11050
17760: My hosts are those I would bless,
17761: A brave, a hospitable pair,
17762: Who if I meet them, I confess,
17763: Must already be white haired.
17764: Ah! They were pious people!             11055
17765: Shall I call, or knock? – Greetings,
17766: If, as open-hearted, you still
17767: Enjoy good luck, in meetings!
17768: 
17769: Baucis (A little woman, very aged.)
17770: 
17771: Gentle stranger! Quietly, quietly!
17772: Peace! Let my husband rest!             11060
17773: Long sleep lends the elderly,
17774: Little time to work, at best.
17775: 
17776: The Wanderer
17777: 
17778: Tell me, Mother: are you that wife
17779: To whom thanks should be given:
17780: Who brought a young man back to life,   11065
17781: When wife and husband worked as one?
17782: Are you that Baucis who tirelessly
17783: Restored my almost-vanished breath?
17784: 
17785: (Her husband appears.)
17786: 
17787: Are you that Philemon, who bravely
17788: Saved my wealth from watery death?              11070
17789: Your swiftly burning fire,
17790: Your silvery sounding bell,
17791: In chance, dread and dire,
17792: Was the outcome that befell.
17793: And now let me walk about,                      11075
17794: And view the boundless ocean:
17795: Let me kneel, and be devout:
17796: Mind troubled with emotion.
17797: 
17798: (He walks on, over the downs.)
17799: 
17800: Philemon (To Baucis.)
17801: 
17802: Hurry now, and lay the table,
17803: Underneath the garden trees.                    11080
17804: Let him go: as in the fable,
17805: He’ll not credit what he sees.
17806: 
17807: (He follows, and stands beside the Wanderer.)
17808: 
17809: Where wave on wave, foaming wildly,
17810: Savagely mistreated you,
17811: See a garden planted, widely,                   11085
17812: See the Paradisial view.
17813: I was too old to seize the day,
17814: Unfit to work as long ago:
17815: And while my powers ebbed away,
17816: The tide extended its wide flow.                11090
17817: Clever Lords set their bold servants
17818: Digging ditches, building dikes,
17819: To gain the mastery of ocean,
17820: Diminishing its natural rights.
17821: See green meadow bordering meadow,              11095
17822: Field and garden, wood and town. –
17823: But it’s time to eat, so follow,
17824: Sunset is approaching now.
17825: See the sails, far away there,
17826: Seeking port before the night.                  11100
17827: The birds fly homeward through the air:
17828: Their harbour too heaves in sight.
17829: So gaze then, at the whole horizon,
17830: Where the blue sea used to flow,
17831: Right and left there, to your vision,   11105
17832: Densely peopled space below.
17833: Part II Act V Scene II: In the Little Garden
17834: 
17835: (The three of them at table.)
17836: 
17837: Baucis (To the stranger.)
17838: 
17839: Are you dumb? And will you lift
17840: Not a morsel to your mouth?
17841: 
17842: Philemon
17843: 
17844: He wants to comprehend the gift:
17845: Tell him, freely then: speak out.              11110
17846: 
17847: Baucis
17848: 
17849: Well! It was a marvel, really!
17850: It troubles me to this day:
17851: Then its whole nature, surely,
17852: Was peculiar, in its way.
17853: 
17854: Philemon
17855: 
17856: Is the Emperor, then, at fault,                11115
17857: Who granted him the land?
17858: Didn’t a herald make his halt,
17859: Crying out what was planned?
17860: Not far away there, on the dunes,
17861: The first bold step was made,                  11120
17862: Tents, huts! – And on the downs,
17863: A palace, quickly raised.
17864: 
17865: Baucis
17866: 
17867: For days, work rumbled on in vain,
17868: Pick and shovel, blow on blow:
17869: Where the night’s fires flamed,                11125
17870: Next day a dam would follow.
17871: Human blood was forced to flow,
17872: At night, rose the sound of pain:
17873: The seaward floating fiery glow
17874: Was a canal, come dawn again.         11130
17875: He’s a godless man: he’d steal
17876: Our hut, and our few acres:
17877: But like subjects we must kneel,
17878: When we boast such neighbours.
17879: 
17880: Philemon
17881: 
17882: Yet he’s offered us another           11135
17883: Holding, on his new-won land!
17884: 
17885: Baucis
17886: 
17887: Never trust what’s built on water,
17888: On the heights maintain your stand.
17889: 
17890: Philemon
17891: 
17892: Let’s make our way to the chapel,
17893: To watch the last glow of light,      11140
17894: Kneel, pray, and sound the bell,
17895: And trust in God’s ancient might!
17896: Part II Act V Scene III: The Palace
17897: 
17898: (Spacious pleasure-gardens: a broad straight canal. Faust in extreme old
17899: age, walking about, thoughtfully.)
17900: 
17901: Lynceus, the Warder (Through a speaking trumpet.)
17902: 
17903: The sun is fading, the last boats
17904: Sail swiftly to the harbour here.
17905: One large vessel gently floats,                                      11145
17906: Down the canal: and draws near.
17907: The bright flags flutter merrily,
17908: The masts are trimmed, in time:
17909: The boatmen all praise you gladly,
17910: Fortune celebrates your prime.                                       11150
17911: 
17912: (The little bell on the dunes rings out.)
17913: 
17914: Faust (Startled.)
17915: 
17916: Accursed ringing! Wounding me
17917: With shame: a treacherous blow:
17918: My realm’s laid out there, endlessly,
17919: But, at my back, this vexes so,
17920: Proclaiming, with its jealous sound:                                 11155
17921: My great estate is less than fine,
17922: The old hut, all the trees around,
17923: The crumbling chapel, are not mine.
17924: And even if I wished to rest there,
17925: A strange shadow makes me shudder,                                   11160
17926: It’s a thorn in my eye, and deeper:
17927: Oh! Would I were somewhere other!
17928: 
17929: The Warder (From above.)
17930: 
17931: The boat is sailing, brightly dressed,
17932: Towards us, on the evening breeze!
17933: Heaped, with boxes, sacks and chests,                                11165
17934: From its journey on the seas!
17935: (A splendid boat, richly and brightly loaded with foreign goods.)
17936: 
17937: (Mephistopheles. The Three Mighty Warriors.)
17938: 
17939: Chorus
17940: 
17941: Here we land,
17942: Already, here.
17943: Hail to our Lord,
17944: Our patron dear!                                                    11170
17945: 
17946: (They disembark: the goods are unloaded.)
17947: 
17948: Mephistopheles
17949: 
17950: We’ve proven ourselves in every way,
17951: Pleased, if we win our patron’s praise.
17952: We took two ships when we sailed before
17953: With twenty ships we dock, once more.
17954: What we’ve achieved, each fine thing,                               11175
17955: You’ll see from the cargo that we bring.
17956: The ocean’s freedom frees the mind
17957: There all thought is left behind!
17958: You only need a handy grip,
17959: You catch a fish, or take a ship,                                   11180
17960: And once you’re lord of all three,
17961: The fourth one’s tackled easily:
17962: The fifth one’s in an evil plight,
17963: You have the might, and so the right.
17964: You wonder what, and never how.                                     11185
17965: I know a little of navigation:
17966: War, trade, and piracy, allow,
17967: As three in one, no separation.
17968: The Three Mighty Warriors
17969: 
17970: No thanks for us!
17971: No thanks at all!               11190
17972: As if we’ve brought
17973: A stench, that’s all.
17974: He pulls a
17975: Nasty face again:
17976: These royal goods               11195
17977: Don’t please him then.
17978: 
17979: Mephistopheles
17980: 
17981: Don’t expect more
17982: Pay for it!
17983: What you’ve had
17984: Is what you get.                11200
17985: 
17986: The Warriors
17987: 
17988: That was only
17989: To pass the time:
17990: We want an equal
17991: Share in crime.
17992: 
17993: Mephistopheles
17994: 
17995: Then first set out in           11205
17996: Hall on hall,
17997: The costly treasures,
17998: One and all!
17999: And coming to
18000: The splendid show,              11210
18001: He’ll think it all the
18002: More, you know,
18003: He won’t be mean,
18004: With you, at least,
18005: He’ll give the fleet,           11215
18006: Feast on feast.
18007: Tomorrow motley birds attend,
18008: I want to take good care of them.
18009: 
18010: (The cargo is removed.)
18011: 
18012: (To Faust.)
18013: 
18014: This splendid fortune you embrace
18015: With wrinkled brow, and gloomy face!         11220
18016: Your noble wisdom has been crowned,
18017: Sea’s reconciled with solid ground:
18018: From the shore, on swifter track,
18019: The sea wills out the ship, and back:
18020: So speak, that here, from your spire,        11225
18021: Your arms might grip the world entire.
18022: From this place the trench was cut,
18023: Here stood the first wooden hut:
18024: A little ditch was traced from here,
18025: Where now vessels’ wakes appear.             11230
18026: Your servants’ toil, your thought so wise,
18027: Have won the Earth and Ocean’s prize.
18028: From here on –
18029: 
18030: Faust
18031:                  – that accursed here!
18032: That always brings me wretched fear,
18033: To you who are so clever, I say it,          11235
18034: It gives my heart sting on sting,
18035: It’s impossible for me to bear it.
18036: I’m ashamed to even speak the thing.
18037: The old ones up there should yield,
18038: I want the limes as my retreat,              11240
18039: The least tree in another’s field,
18040: Detracts from my whole estate.
18041: There, to stand and look around,
18042: I’ll build a frame from bough to bough,
18043: My gaze revealing, under the sun,            11245
18044: A view of everything I’ve done,
18045: Overseeing, as the eye falls on it,
18046: A masterpiece of the human spirit,
18047: Forging with intelligence,
18048: A wider human residence.                          11250
18049: That’s the worst suffering can bring,
18050: Being rich, to feel we lack something.
18051: The bell’s chime, the lindens’ breeze,
18052: Like tombs in churchyards stifle me.
18053: The exercise of my all-conquering will            11255
18054: Is shattered in the sand, here, and lies still.
18055: How can I drive it from my nature!
18056: The bell peals, and I’m an angry creature.
18057: 
18058: Mephistopheles
18059: 
18060: It’s natural! Intense frustration
18061: Drives a man to desperation.                      11260
18062: Who doubts it! That clang I fear
18063: Falls cruelly on a noble ear.
18064: And that wretched bing-bang-bong,
18065: Through the clear evening sky, that gong,
18066: Is joined to every chance event,                  11265
18067: From first bath to last interment.
18068: As if between its bing and bong
18069: Life’s a dream, and then is gone.
18070: 
18071: Faust
18072: 
18073: Such obstinacy and opposition
18074: Diminishes the noblest position,                  11270
18075: Until in endless pain, one must
18076: Grow deeply weary of being just.
18077: 
18078: Mephistopheles
18079: 
18080: Why bother yourself so much about them?
18081: Shouldn’t you long ago have colonised them?
18082: Faust
18083: 
18084: Then go and push them aside for me! –           11275
18085: You know the land, with my approval,
18086: Set aside for the old folks removal.
18087: 
18088: Mephistopheles
18089: 
18090: We’ll take them up, and set them down,
18091: They’ll stand, once more: I’ll be bound:
18092: When they’ve survived a little force,           11280
18093: They’ll be reconciled to it, of course.
18094: 
18095: (He whistles shrilly.)
18096: 
18097: Come: perform your Lord’s command!
18098: And tomorrow let the feast be planned.
18099: 
18100: The Three Warriors
18101: 
18102: This old Lord received us badly,
18103: A feast now is our right: believe me.           11285
18104: 
18105: Mephistopheles (To the audience.)
18106: 
18107: And here we see, as long ago
18108: Naboth’s vineyard still on show. (Kings I:21)
18109: Part II Act V Scene IV: Dead of Night
18110: 
18111: Lynceus, the Warder (Singing on the watch-tower of the palace.)
18112: 
18113: For seeing, I’m born,
18114: For watching, employed,
18115: To the tower, I’m sworn,                                          11290
18116: While the world, I enjoy.
18117: I gaze at the far,
18118: I stare at the near,
18119: The moon and the star,
18120: The forest and deer:                                              11295
18121: The eternally lovely
18122: Adornment, I view,
18123: And as it delights me
18124: I delight myself too.
18125: You, fortunate eyes,                                              11300
18126: All you’ve seen, there,
18127: Let it be as it may,
18128: Yet it was so fair!
18129: 
18130: (Pause.)
18131: 
18132: I’m not positioned here, on high,
18133: Just for my own enjoyment:                                        11305
18134: What horror, meant to terrify,
18135: Threatens from the firmament!
18136: I see sparks of fire gushing
18137: Through the lindens’ double night,
18138: Fanned by the wind’s rushing,                                     11310
18139: Ever stronger grows the light.
18140: Ah! Within, the hut is burning,
18141: Damp and mossy though it stand:
18142: Swift help, in this direction turning,
18143: Is needed, yet no aid’s to hand.                                  11315
18144: Ah! The pious old couple,
18145: So careful ever of the fire,
18146: Made a prey to smoke, to stifle,
18147: On this dreadful pyre!
18148: The flame burns on: glowing red,
18149: It’s now a blackened mossy pile:                 11320
18150: If only those good folk are rescued,
18151: From those fires of hell, run wild!
18152: A bright tongue of lightning heaves,
18153: Through the branches, through the leaves:        11325
18154: Breaking, snapping, catching swiftly,
18155: Withered branches flicker, glow.
18156: Why have I such powers to see!
18157: Why are mine the eyes that know!
18158: The little chapel now collapses,                 11330
18159: With the falling branches’ weight.
18160: Already with bright snakelike flashes,
18161: The treetops, gripped, meet their fate.
18162: Glowing crimson, to their hollow
18163: Roots, the trunks now burn with ease. –          11335
18164: 
18165: (A long pause. Chant.)
18166: 
18167: What used to please my eyes, below,
18168: Has vanished with the centuries.
18169: 
18170: Faust (On the balcony, towards the downs.)
18171: 
18172: What whining song is that, above?
18173: Too late its word and tone reach me.
18174: The watchman wails: yes, I’m moved:              11340
18175: Annoyed by this impatient deed.
18176: But let the lime-trees be erased,
18177: A horror now of half-burnt timber,
18178: A watchtower can soon be raised,
18179: To gaze around at boundless splendour.           11345
18180: From there I’ll see my new creation,
18181: One set aside for that old pair: at least,
18182: They’ll feel benign consideration,
18183: Enjoying their last days in peace.
18184: 
18185: Mephistopheles and the Three Warriors (Below.)
18186: 
18187: Here we come, and at the double:                 11350
18188: Pardon us! We’ve caused you trouble.
18189: We knocked, and knocked on the door,
18190: But it seemed locked for evermore:
18191: We rattled it, and shook it too,
18192: Until the planks broke in two:                  11355
18193: We called aloud, and threatened, then,
18194: But there was no reply, again.
18195: And as happens in such cases,
18196: They heard nothing, hid their faces:
18197: But we commenced without delay                  11360
18198: To drive the stubborn folk away.
18199: That pair knew scant anxiety,
18200: They died of terror, peacefully.
18201: A stranger, who was hiding there,
18202: And wished to fight, we tried to scare.         11365
18203: But in the fast and furious bout,
18204: From the coals that lay about,
18205: The straw took fire. Now all three,
18206: In that one pyre, burn merrily.
18207: 
18208: Faust
18209: 
18210: Were you deaf to what I said?                   11370
18211: I wanted them moved, not dead.
18212: This mindless, and savage blow,
18213: Earns my curse: share it, and go!
18214: 
18215: Chorus
18216: 
18217: The ancient proverb says of course:
18218: Yield willingly to a greater force!             11375
18219: While if you’re bold and opt for strife,
18220: You’ll stake your house, and home – and life.
18221: 
18222: (They exit.)
18223: 
18224: Faust (On the balcony.)
18225: 
18226: Stars hide their faces, and their glow,
18227: The fire sinks, and flickers low:
18228: A moist breeze fans the dying ember,            11380
18229: Bringing smoke and vapour closer.
18230: Quickly said, too quickly done, I fear! –
18231: Now, what hovers like a shadow, here?
18232: Part II Act V Scene V: Midnight
18233: 
18234: (Four Grey Women enter.)
18235: 
18236: The First
18237: 
18238: I am called Want.
18239: 
18240: The Second
18241: 
18242:                     I am called Guilt.
18243: 
18244: The Third
18245: 
18246: I am called Care.
18247: 
18248: The Fourth
18249: 
18250:                     Necessity, I.                  11385
18251: 
18252: 
18253: Three Together (Want, Guilt and Necessity)
18254: 
18255: The door is shut tight, and we cannot get in:
18256: The owner is rich: he won’t have us within.
18257: 
18258: Want
18259: 
18260: I shrink to a shadow.
18261: 
18262: Guilt
18263: 
18264:                               To emptiest space.
18265: 
18266: Need
18267: 
18268: The wealthy from me turn their pampered face.
18269: Care
18270: 
18271: Sisters, you can’t enter, daren’t enter there.         11390
18272: But, through the keyhole now, always slips, Care.
18273: 
18274: (Care disappears.)
18275: 
18276: Want
18277: 
18278: You, my Grey Sisters, take your flight too.
18279: 
18280: Guilt
18281: 
18282: Close by your side, I come following you.
18283: 
18284: Necessity
18285: 
18286: Close at your heels is Necessity’s breath.
18287: 
18288: The Three
18289: 
18290: The clouds there are moving, and cover the stars!      11395
18291: Behind us, behind us! From far, oh, from far,
18292: He’s coming, our Brother, he’s coming, he’s – Death.
18293: 
18294: Faust (In the Palace.)
18295: 
18296: I saw four: but only three went away:
18297: I caught no meaning from the words they say.
18298: It sounded as if I heard – ‘Necessity’s breath’,       11400
18299: And then a gloomy rhyming word, like – ‘Death’.
18300: It rang hollow, ghostly, subdued, to me.
18301: Even now I’ve not won my liberty.
18302: If I could banish Sorcery from my track,
18303: Unlearn the magic-spells that draw me back,            11405
18304: And stand before you, Nature, as mere Man,
18305: It would be worth the pain of being Human.
18306: So was I, a seeker in the darkness,
18307: Cursing both self and world, in wickedness.
18308: Now the air is filled with phantom shapes,             11410
18309: It’s hard to see how anyone escapes.
18310: Though day may smile on us with rational gleams,
18311: The night entwines us in a web of dreams:
18312: We come happily from the fields of youth,
18313: A bird croaks: what? Misfortune: is our truth.              11415
18314: Cloaked with superstitions, soon and late:
18315: It’s wedded to us, warns us: shows our fate.
18316: And so, alone, intimidated, we stand.
18317: The door creaks, yet no one is at hand.
18318: 
18319: (Anxiously.)
18320: 
18321: Is anyone there?
18322: 
18323: Care
18324:                     The answer must be, yes!                11420
18325: 
18326: Faust
18327: 
18328: And you, who then are you?
18329: 
18330: Care
18331: 
18332:                              I am your guest.
18333: 
18334: Faust
18335: 
18336: Be gone!
18337: 
18338: Care
18339: 
18340:                I am here, in my proper place.
18341: 
18342: Faust (First angered, then composed, addressing himself.)
18343: 
18344: Take care: of magic spells show not a trace.
18345: Care
18346: 
18347: Though the ear choose not to hear,
18348: In the heart I echo, clear:                  11425
18349: Savage power I exercise,
18350: Transformed I am, to mortal eyes.
18351: On the land, and on the ocean,
18352: Evermore the dread companion,
18353: Always found, and never sought,              11430
18354: Praised, as well as cursed, in thought. –
18355: Have you yourself not known Care?
18356: 
18357: Faust
18358: 
18359: I sped through the World that’s there:
18360: Gripped by the hair every appetite,
18361: And let go those that failed to delight,     11435
18362: Let those fly that quite escaped me.
18363: I’ve desired, achieved my course,
18364: Desired again, and so, with force,
18365: Stormed through life: first powerfully,
18366: But wisely now: and thoughtfully.            11440
18367: Earth’s sphere’s familiar enough to me,
18368: The view beyond is barred eternally:
18369: The fool who sets his sights up there,
18370: Creates his own likeness in the air!
18371: Let him stand, and look around him well:     11445
18372: This world means something to the capable.
18373: Why does he need to roam eternity!
18374: Let him grasp what is firm reality.
18375: So let him wander down his earthly day:
18376: And if ghosts haunt him, go on his way,      11450
18377: Find joy and suffering in striding on,
18378: Dissatisfied with every hour that’s gone.
18379: Care
18380: 
18381: When of man I take possession,
18382: Then his whole world is lessened:
18383: Endless gloom meets his eyes,        11455
18384: No more suns will set or rise,
18385: Though intact, to outer sense,
18386: He lives in the dark, intense,
18387: Never knowing how to measure
18388: Any portion of his treasure.         11460
18389: Good and ill are merely chance,
18390: He starves, food in his hands:
18391: Be it joy or be it sorrow
18392: He delays it till tomorrow,
18393: Waiting for the future, ever,        11465
18394: Finding his fulfilment, never.
18395: 
18396: Faust
18397: 
18398: Be gone! And don’t come near me!
18399: Such nonsense I’ll not understand.
18400: Away, with your evil litany,
18401: Sent to confuse the cleverest man!   11470
18402: 
18403: Care
18404: 
18405: Shall he come, or shall he go?
18406: All decision is denied him:
18407: In the middle of the road,
18408: He staggers, feeling round him.
18409: He’s ever more deeply lost,          11475
18410: Seeing everything star-crossed,
18411: Wearies himself and all the rest,
18412: Stifles as he holds his breath:
18413: Lifeless, but not yet gone under,
18414: Resists despair or surrender.        11480
18415: So, with an incessant rolling,
18416: A painful end, and hard going,
18417: Now free, and now constrained,
18418: In half sleep, poorly entertained,
18419: Confine him in a little space:                     11485
18420: Prepare him for Hell’s other place.
18421: 
18422: Faust
18423: 
18424: Unholy spectre! So you hand our race
18425: To the ravages of a thousand devils:
18426: Even transform our worthless days
18427: To a wretched knot of entangling evils.            11490
18428: It’s hard I know to free oneself from Demons,
18429: The strong spirit-bonds are not lightly broken:
18430: And yet, Care, I’ll not recognise you, nor even,
18431: That creeping power of yours, by any token.
18432: 
18433: Care
18434: 
18435: Feel it now, as on the wind,                       11495
18436: I, and my curse, depart, again.
18437: Lifelong, all you men are blind,
18438: Now, Faust, be so to the end!
18439: 
18440: (She breathes in his face, and departs.)
18441: 
18442: Faust (Now blind.)
18443: 
18444: The night seems deeper all around me,
18445: Only within me is there gleaming light:            11500
18446: I must finish what I’ve done, and hurry,
18447: The master’s word alone declares what’s right.
18448: Up from your beds, you slaves! Man on man!
18449: Reveal the daring of my favoured plan.
18450: Seize the tools: on with pick and spade!           11505
18451: Let the end-result be now displayed.
18452: Strict order, and swift industry
18453: Then the finest prize we’ll see:
18454: And so the greatest work may stand,
18455: One mind equal to a thousand hands.                11510
18456: Part II Act V Scene VI: The Great Outer Court of the Palace
18457: 
18458: (Torches.)
18459: 
18460: Mephistopheles (In advance, as Overseer.)
18461: 
18462: Come on! Come on! In here, in here!
18463: Quivering spirits of the dead,
18464: All you patchwork semi-natures,
18465: Sinew, bone, and tendon wed.
18466: 
18467: The Spirits of the Dead (Lemures, in Chorus.)
18468: 
18469: Swiftly now we are on hand                                    11515
18470: With half an impression,
18471: That it concerns a tract of land,
18472: Of which we’ll gain possession.
18473: Pointed stakes with us appear,
18474: Chains to measure ground on:                                  11520
18475: But why you’ve called us here
18476: Is something we’ve forgotten.
18477: 
18478: Mephistopheles
18479: 
18480: Artistic effort’s not the prize:
18481: Carry it out in your own manner!
18482: Lay the longest one of you lengthwise,                        11525
18483: Then pile the turf on him, you others.
18484: Do as they once did for our fathers there,
18485: Dig out a somewhat lengthened square!
18486: Gone from a palace to a narrow place:
18487: It’s still as stupid an end for man to face.                  11530
18488: 
18489: The Spirits of the Dead (Digging with mocking gestures.)
18490: 
18491: When I was young and lived and loved,
18492: I thought it was very sweet:
18493: To happy sounds, and cheerful steps,
18494: I lifted up my feet.
18495: Now treacherous old age has clawed                                   11535
18496: Me with his crutch, since when
18497: I stumble at the grave’s wide door,
18498: Why do they leave it open!
18499: 
18500: Faust (Comes from the Palace, groping his way past the doorposts.)
18501: 
18502: How the clattering of shovels cheers me!
18503: It’s the crews still labouring on,                                   11540
18504: Till earth is reconciled to man,
18505: The waves accept their boundaries,
18506: And ocean’s bound with iron bands.
18507: 
18508: Mephistopheles (Aside.)
18509: 
18510: And yet with all your walls and dams
18511: You’re merely dancing to our tune:                                   11545
18512: Since you prepare for our Neptune,
18513: The Water-demon, one vast feast.
18514: You’ll be lost in every way –
18515: The elements are ours, today,
18516: And ruin comes on running feet.                                      11550
18517: 
18518: Faust
18519: 
18520: Overseer!
18521: 
18522: Mephistopheles
18523: 
18524:             Here!
18525: 
18526: Faust
18527: 
18528:                   Any way you can
18529: Bring crowds of labourers together,
18530: Spurred by force or hope of pleasure,
18531: By pay, enticement or press-gang!
18532: Report to me on progress every day,                                  11555
18533: The depth of earth and gravel dug away.
18534: Mephistopheles (Half-aloud.)
18535: 
18536: Reporting it to me the word they gave,
18537: Was not quite gravel, it was more like – grave.
18538: 
18539: Faust
18540: 
18541: A swamp lies there below the hill,
18542: Infecting everything I’ve done:                       11560
18543: My last and greatest act of will
18544: Succeeds when that foul pool is gone.
18545: Let me make room for many a million,
18546: Not wholly secure, but free to work on.
18547: Green fertile fields, where men and herds             11565
18548: May gain swift comfort from the new-made earth.
18549: Quickly settled in those hills’ embrace,
18550: Piled high by a brave, industrious race.
18551: And in the centre here, a Paradise,
18552: Whose boundaries hold back the raging tide,           11570
18553: And though it gnaws to enter in by force,
18554: The common urge unites to halt its course.
18555: Yes, I’ve surrendered to this thought’s insistence,
18556: The last word Wisdom ever has to say:
18557: He only earns his Freedom and Existence,              11575
18558: Who’s forced to win them freshly every day.
18559: Childhood, manhood, age’s vigorous years,
18560: Surrounded by dangers, they’ll spend here.
18561: I wish to gaze again on such a land,
18562: Free earth: where a free race, in freedom, stand.     11580
18563: Then, to the Moment I’d dare say:
18564: ‘Stay a while! You are so lovely!’
18565: Through aeons, then, never to fade away
18566: This path of mine through all that’s earthly. –
18567: Anticipating, here, its deep enjoyment,               11585
18568: Now I savour it, that highest moment.
18569: (Faust sinks back, the spirits of the dead take him and lay him on the
18570: ground.)
18571: 
18572: Mephistopheles
18573: 
18574: No bliss satisfied him, no enjoyment,
18575: And so he tried to catch at shifting forms:
18576: The last, the worst, the emptiest of moments,
18577: He wished to hold at last in his arms.                                   11590
18578: Though against me he tried to stand,
18579: Time is master: age lies on the sand.
18580: The clock stands still –
18581: 
18582: Chorus
18583: 
18584: Stands still! As midnight: silent.
18585: The hand moves.
18586: 
18587: Mephistopheles
18588: 
18589: It falls, and all is spent.
18590: 
18591: Chorus
18592: 
18593: It’s past.
18594: 
18595: Mephistopheles
18596: 
18597:         Past! A stupid word.                                             11595
18598: Then, why?
18599: Past, and pure nothing, complete monotony!
18600: What use is this eternal creation!
18601: Creating, to achieve annihilation!
18602: ‘There, it’s past!’ What’s to read in it?                                11600
18603: It’s just the same as if it never lived,
18604: Yet chases round in circles, as if it did.
18605: I’d prefer to have the everlasting void.
18606: Burial
18607: 
18608: A Spirit of the Dead (Solo.)
18609: 
18610: Who’s built the house so badly,
18611: With shovel and with spade?                          11605
18612: 
18613: Spirits of the Dead (Chorus.)
18614: 
18615: For you dull guest, in hempen dress,
18616: It was all too carefully made.
18617: 
18618: A Spirit of the Dead (Solo.)
18619: 
18620: Who’s decked the hall so badly?
18621: Where now the table and chairs?
18622: 
18623: Spirits of the Dead (Chorus.)
18624: 
18625: Borrowed for a little while:                         11610
18626: There are many creditors.
18627: 
18628: Mephistopheles
18629: 
18630: The body’s here: if the spirit tries to fly,
18631: I’ll show it my blood-signed title swiftly:
18632: Yet men have found so many methods, sadly,
18633: To cheat the Devil of their souls, or try.           11615
18634: We carry on the same old way,
18635: New ones aren’t recommended:
18636: I used to work alone: today
18637: I have to use the help extended.
18638: And everything goes badly too!                       11620
18639: Ancient right, traditional use,
18640: One can’t rely on those much longer.
18641: At the last breath, once, the soul was out,
18642: I slipped by, and like the swiftest mouse,
18643: Caught her! Held her fast, my claws were stronger.   11625
18644: Now she lingers, won’t leave the gloomy place,
18645: The foul corpse’s hideous house, until
18646: The elements force her, in hatred still,
18647: And drive her out at last, in disgrace.
18648: And though the hour and minute plague me,              11630
18649: ‘When’, ‘how’ and ‘where’, still the tiresome query:
18650: Old Death has lost his ancient power,
18651: ‘Whether’ is doubtful, never mind the hour:
18652: Often, with lust, I saw the rigid frame
18653: It was a sham: it stirred, and rose again.             11635
18654: 
18655: (He makes fantastic, whirling conjuring gestures.)
18656: 
18657: Now quick! Redouble your paces, too,
18658: You gentlemen, straight or twisted-horned,
18659: The old Devil’s grain and kernel born,
18660: And bring Hell’s jaws along with you.
18661: True Hell has many jaws! Yes, many!                    11640
18662: To swallow according to standing and worth:
18663: However in this last game of all we’re ready
18664: To be a little less considerate, henceforth.
18665: 
18666: (The fearful jaws of Hell open on the left.)
18667: 
18668: The tusks yawn wide: the jaws of the abyss,
18669: Flow with raging flames, in fury,                      11645
18670: And in the boiling background hiss,
18671: I see the eternal glow of the fiery city.
18672: The crimson tide breaks against the teeth,
18673: The damned in hope of help swim through:
18674: But the vast hyena mangles them beneath,               11650
18675: And sends them to new anguish in the brew.
18676: There are many corners to discover,
18677: So many horrors in such little room!
18678: You’ve done quite well at frightening sinners,
18679: But still they think it dream, deceit, untrue.         11655
18680: 
18681: (To the fat devils with short straight horns.)
18682: 
18683: Now, you fat-bellied rascals with fiery cheeks!
18684: You’ve grown that way eating hellish sulphur:
18685: Stumpy, short, with thick immoveable necks!
18686: Watch below, for any glow of phosphor:
18687: That’s the soul, Psyche with the wings,          11660
18688: Pluck them off and she’s a nasty worm:
18689: I’ll stamp her with my signature, first thing,
18690: Then off with her to the whirling fiery storm!
18691: Pass on towards the nether regions,
18692: You barrels, since all that’s your duty:         11665
18693: Whether she lives there, that’s the notion,
18694: None know with any accuracy.
18695: She’ll gladly lodge in the navel –
18696: Lest she slip away from there, be careful.
18697: 
18698: (To the lean devils with long crooked horns.)
18699: 
18700: You, clowns, you giant flying creatures,         11670
18701: Grasp at the air: grant yourselves no rest!
18702: Your strong arms and sharp-clawed features,
18703: Are sure to hold the fluttering fugitive fast.
18704: She’s stuck there inside her ancient house,
18705: And Spirit will always look for a way out.       11675
18706: 
18707: (Glory from above, on the right.)
18708: 
18709: The Heavenly Host
18710: 
18711: Messengers follow
18712: Heavenly kin, oh,
18713: In leisurely flight:
18714: Sin they forgive,
18715: Dust they make live:                             11680
18716: The friendship they show
18717: To Nature below,
18718: Floating they’ll give,
18719: As they slowly alight!
18720: 
18721: Mephistopheles
18722: 
18723: I hear discords, all that nasty jingling,        11685
18724: Coming from up there, with unwelcome day:
18725: It’s always that childish, girlish bungling,
18726: That pious taste loves to hear and play.
18727: You know how we in despicable moments,
18728: Considered the ruin of the human race:                  11690
18729: But the most shameful of compliments,
18730: Is that their prayers are a worse disgrace.
18731: These dandies come, the hypocrites:
18732: They’ve snatched a heap of souls away,
18733: Use our own weapons too to do it:                       11695
18734: They’re Devils in disguise, I’d say.
18735: To lose this one is everlasting shame:
18736: On to the grave, and renew your claim!
18737: 
18738: The Choir of Angels (Scattering roses)
18739: 
18740: Roses, you dazzling ones,
18741: Balsam you’re sending us,                               11700
18742: Floating and trembling,
18743: Secretly quickening,
18744: Branches inspiring us,
18745: Buds sweetly firing us,
18746: Hasten to bloom!                                        11705
18747: Crimson and green, here
18748: Springtime assume!
18749: Carry the sleeper
18750: To Paradise’ room.
18751: 
18752: Mephistopheles (To the devils.)
18753: 
18754: Why duck and dive? Is that Hell’s custom?               11710
18755: Stand still, and let them do their scattering.
18756: Every gawk in place, and face them!
18757: They think with such a flowery smattering,
18758: To cool the heat of devils’ chattering:
18759: At your breath it melts and shrinks, again.             11715
18760: Now blow, you blowers! – Enough, enough!
18761: Your bubbling’s faded all that stuff. –
18762: Not so fiercely! Close your mouths and noses!
18763: Ah, now you’ve been too violent with the roses,
18764: Where’s the moderation you should have learnt?          11720
18765: They’re not just shrivelling: they’re burning, burnt!
18766: They float about in flames, poisonous, bright:
18767: Avoid them: close together, huddle tight! –
18768: Your power’s waning! And your courage too!
18769: The devils sniff the strange, seductive brew.         11725
18770: 
18771: The Choir of Angels
18772: 
18773: Blossoms, of joyfulness,
18774: Flames, of true happiness,
18775: Love, they radiate,
18776: Bliss, they now create,
18777: As the heart may.                                     11730
18778: Words that are truest,
18779: Air of the clearest,
18780: Gathering round us
18781: Eternal day!
18782: 
18783: Mephistopheles
18784: 
18785: O, curses! O shower of shame that’s shed!             11735
18786: Each Satan’s standing on his head,
18787: The Fatties spin like tops, in curves,
18788: And plunge arse-upwards into Hell.
18789: Go find the hot baths you deserve!
18790: While at my post I’ll stand here still. –             11740
18791: 
18792: (He beats at the hovering roses.)
18793: 
18794: Will-o’-the wisps, be gone! Though you burn bright,
18795: Snatched at, in the end, you’re disgusting shite.
18796: Why’d you keep fluttering here? Buzz off! –
18797: They stick like tar and sulphur: filthy stuff.
18798: 
18799: The Choir of Angels
18800: 
18801: What is not part of you,                              11745
18802: You need not share it:
18803: What inwardly troubles you,
18804: You need not bear it.
18805: Should it close in, with force,
18806: We will deflect its course.                             11750
18807: Only the loving, Love
18808: Guides to its source!
18809: 
18810: Mephistopheles
18811: 
18812: My head and heart are burnt: my liver’s burnt,
18813: By a devilish element!
18814: Sharper than the fires of Hell! –                       11755
18815: That’s what makes you cry, so, as well,
18816: You, the unlucky in love! Disdained,
18817: Heads turned to the beloved, strained.
18818: Mine, too! What’s twisted it to one side?
18819: Are they and I not sworn to eternal strife?             11760
18820: I, once fiercely hostile to their very sight.
18821: Has an alien force pierced me through and through?
18822: I gladly gaze at them, loveliest of youths:
18823: What holds me back from cursing at the light? –
18824: And if I let myself be seduced,                         11765
18825: Who’ll play the fool in future?
18826: These airy fellows that I hate, too,
18827: How lovely to me now they all appear! –
18828: You sweet children, tell me then:
18829: Aren’t you part of Lucifer’s race?                      11770
18830: You’re so nice I’d like to kiss you, and again,
18831: It feels as if this is your proper place.
18832: It feels as comfortable, as natural to me,
18833: As if we’d met a thousand times before:
18834: So surreptitiously catlike, so lustfully:               11775
18835: The loveliness with each glance quickens more.
18836: Oh, come nearer: Oh, only glance at me!
18837: 
18838: The Angels
18839: 
18840: We’re here already, why so cautiously?
18841: We are close, and, if you can, then stay!
18842: 
18843: (The Angels come forward and occupy the whole space.)
18844: Mephistopheles (Crowded into the proscenium.)
18845: 
18846: You scorn us, the spirits of the damned,          11780
18847: Yet you’re of the true Sorcerers’ brand:
18848: You lead both man and wife astray. –
18849: What wretched luck, and dire!
18850: Is this Love’s own element?
18851: My whole body’s bathed in fire,                   11785
18852: I scarcely feel, my head’s so burnt. –
18853: You float to and fro, sink down a while,
18854: Move your sweet limbs with earthly guile:
18855: True, a grave expression suits you well,
18856: But I’d still like to see you smile a little!     11790
18857: That would be an eternal delight to me.
18858: Like the lovers’ mutual glance, you see:
18859: A simper round the mouth, is how it’s done,
18860: You, the tall lad, you could make me love you,
18861: The priest’s pose doesn’t really suit you,        11795
18862: So show a little lust, and look hereon!
18863: You could be more modestly naked too,
18864: That robe’s long hem, so demure in its rising –
18865: They turn away – and seen from the rear view –
18866: Those rascals now are really appetising!          11800
18867: 
18868: The Choir of Angels
18869: 
18870: You, loving fires,
18871: Brighter, now, fanned,
18872: Heal the damned,
18873: With Truth, the higher!
18874: Let them be freed                                 11805
18875: From evil indeed,
18876: Blissfully grace,
18877: The eternal embrace.
18878: Mephistopheles (Collecting himself.)
18879: 
18880: What’s happening to me! – Like Job, in fact
18881: All boils: so I scare myself, and yet I’ve won           11810
18882: As well, since, now my inspection’s done,
18883: And my trust in self and tribe’s well placed,
18884: The Devil’s noble bits appear intact,
18885: This love-bewitchment’s only on the surface:
18886: The wretched flames already smother,                     11815
18887: And, as is right, I curse you all together!
18888: 
18889: The Choir of Angels
18890: 
18891: Pure incandescence!
18892: Whom its flames bless,
18893: Blissful with goodness,
18894: Is their existence.                                      11820
18895: Gathered together,
18896: Rise now, and praise!
18897: Spirit can breathe here,
18898: In purer waves!
18899: 
18900: (They rise, carrying away the immortal part of Faust.)
18901: 
18902: Mephistopheles (Looking round him.)
18903: 
18904: How then? – Where did they vanish to?                    11825
18905: You took me by surprise, you adolescents.
18906: Now with what they’ve salvaged from the tomb,
18907: As their own prize, they’ve flown off to heaven:
18908: They’ve stolen a great, a unique treasure:
18909: That noble soul, mortgaged to my pleasure,               11830
18910: They’ve snatched it away, with cunning even.
18911: But whom could I complain to, anyway?
18912: Who’d grant me my well-earned right?
18913: You’ve been swindled in your old age,
18914: You’ve deserved it, this wretched slight.                11835
18915: At great expense, shameful! And it’s gone:
18916: I’ve mishandled it all disgracefully,
18917: A common lust, an absurd passion,
18918: Swayed the hardened devil foolishly.
18919: And if Experience was in a mess,            11840
18920: With all these childish, stupid things,
18921: It was, in truth, no trivial Foolishness,
18922: That took possession of him in the end.
18923: Part II Act V Scene VII: Mountain Gorges, Forest, Rock, Desert
18924: 
18925: (Holy Hermits, divided in ascending planes, posted among the ravines.)
18926: 
18927: Chorus and Echo
18928: 
18929: Forests, they wave around,
18930: Over them, cliffs bear down,                                        11845
18931: Roots cling to rocky ground,
18932: Trunk upon trunk is bound,
18933: Wave after wave sprays up,
18934: Deep caves protecting us.
18935: Lions prowl silently,                                               11850
18936: Round us, still friendly,
18937: Honouring sacred space,
18938: Love’s holy hiding place.
18939: 
18940: Pater Ecstaticus (Hovering up and down.)
18941: 
18942: Eternal, fire of bliss,
18943: Glow of love’s bond this is,                                        11855
18944: Pain in the heart, seething,
18945: Rapture divine, foaming.
18946: Arrows, come, piercing me,
18947: Spears, compelling me,
18948: Clubs, you may shatter me,                                          11860
18949: Lightning may flash through me!
18950: So passes the nullity
18951: Of all unreality,
18952: And from the lasting star
18953: Shines Love’s eternal core.                                         11865
18954: 
18955: Pater Profundis (At a lower level.)
18956: 
18957: As this rocky abyss at my feet,
18958: Rests on a deeper abyss,
18959: As a thousand glittering streams meet
18960: In the foaming flood’s downward hiss,
18961: As with its own strong impulse, above,                              11870
18962: The tree lifts skywards in the air:
18963: Even so all-powerful love,
18964: Creates all things, in its care.
18965: Around me there’s a savage roar,
18966: As if the rocks and forests sway,            11875
18967: Yet full of love the waters pour,
18968: Rushing bountifully away,
18969: Sent to irrigate the valley here:
18970: The lightning that flashed down,
18971: Must purify the atmosphere,                  11880
18972: With poisonous vapours bound –
18973: They are love’s messengers, they tell
18974: Of what creates eternally around us.
18975: May it inflame me inwardly, as well,
18976: Since my spirit, cold and confounded,        11885
18977: Torments itself, bound in the dull senses,
18978: As sharp-toothed fetters’ agonising art.
18979: Oh, God! Calm my thoughts, pacify us,
18980: And bring light to my needy heart!
18981: 
18982: Pater Seraphicus (In the middle regions.)
18983: 
18984: What a mist of morning hovers                11890
18985: Through the pine-trees’ swaying hair!
18986: Can I guess what it might cover?
18987: A crowd of spirits live there.
18988: 
18989: Choir of Sacred Young Boys
18990: 
18991: Tell us, Father, where we wander,
18992: Tell us, Kind One, who we are?               11895
18993: We are happy: Being’s tender
18994: To all who are, all who are.
18995: 
18996: Pater Seraphicus
18997: 
18998: Young boys! Born at midnight’s hour,
18999: Mind and spirit half-unveiled,
19000: For your parents, a lost dower,              11900
19001: For the angels, profit gained.
19002: You can feel that one who loves
19003: Is near to you, so come to me:
19004: Yet of earthly ways and moves,
19005: You bear no traces, happily.                                   11905
19006: Rise into my eyes, those known
19007: Organs of the earthly life,
19008: You can use them as your own,
19009: Gaze at all the spaces wide!
19010: 
19011: (He absorbs them into himself.)
19012: 
19013: Those are trees: those are cliffs,                             11910
19014: A stream of water, rushing round,
19015: With gigantic leaps it lifts,
19016: Shortening its journey down.
19017: 
19018: The Young Boys (From within him.)
19019: 
19020: That’s indeed a mighty vision,
19021: But it’s gloomy here, you know,                                11915
19022: With fear and dread we’re all shaken.
19023: Father, Kind one, let us go!
19024: 
19025: Pater Seraphicus
19026: 
19027: Rise upwards to the highest sphere,
19028: Grow unnoticed there forever,
19029: While in pure eternal manner,                                  11920
19030: God’s presence makes you stronger.
19031: Such is the spirit’s libation,
19032: Blending with the freest air:
19033: Love’s eternal revelation,
19034: Bliss is unfolded there.                                       11925
19035: 
19036: The Choir of Young Boys (Circling round the highest summit.)
19037: 
19038: Hands now entwining,
19039: Joyfully circling round,
19040: Soaring and singing
19041: With sacred feeling’s sound!
19042: In the divinely taught,                                        11930
19043: Now you should trust:
19044: He whom your worship sought
19045: You’ll see at last.
19046: 
19047: The Angels (Soaring in the highest atmosphere, carrying the immortal part
19048: of Faust.)
19049: 
19050: He’s escaped, this noble member
19051: Of the spirit world, from evil,                                     11935
19052: Whoever strives, in his endeavour,
19053: We can rescue from the devil.
19054: And if he has Love within,
19055: Granted from above,
19056: The sacred crowd will meet him,                                     11940
19057: With welcome, and with love.
19058: 
19059: The Younger Angels
19060: 
19061: Every rose from the hands
19062: Of those penitents, loving, holy,
19063: Helped us win the victory,
19064: The highest work, completed, stands,                                11945
19065: The treasure of this soul we’ve won.
19066: Evil bowed to petals thrown,
19067: Devils fled the blows we threw.
19068: Instead of Hell’s hurts anew,
19069: They felt spirits’ loving pain:                                     11950
19070: Pierced with agony again
19071: The old devil-master too was gone.
19072: Shout with joy! All is done.
19073: 
19074: The More Perfect Angels
19075: 
19076: Carrying earthly remains
19077: Is hard to endure,                                                  11955
19078: Though they survive the flames,
19079: They are still the impure.
19080: Once a great spirit’s strength
19081: So tightly fits
19082: All the four elements,                                              11960
19083: No angel splits
19084: That double nature wed,
19085: The inwardly binding:
19086: To Eternal Love instead
19087: Is left the unwinding.                                                 11965
19088: 
19089: The Younger Angels
19090: 
19091: Misted on rocky heights
19092: Now we are feeling,
19093: Nearing our clearer sight
19094: Spiritual Being.
19095: These clouds are vanishing                                             11970
19096: A crowd I see, moving,
19097: Of sacred young men,
19098: Freed from their earthly gloom,
19099: Circling together,
19100: Delighting again,                                                      11975
19101: In the spring’s brighter bloom,
19102: In higher air.
19103: Let them together then,
19104: Lead him on: risen,
19105: Perfect, and there!                                                    11980
19106: 
19107: The Young Boys
